            " NOTE:Pediatric patients are particularly at risk for a unique type of blowout injury: the “trapdoor” fracture. Because pediatric bones lack complete calcification, they tend to “greenstick” rather than completely fracture. This results in an initial fracture, herniation of orbital soft tissue (including EOM) through the fracture site, and rapid snapping back of the malleable bone akin to a trapdoor on a spring. Because of the tight reapposition of the fracture edges, the soft tissue trapped within the fracture becomes ischemic. Children with this type of fracture often have a remarkably benign external periocular appearance but significant EOM restriction (usually vertical) on examination; this constellation of findings has been dubbed the “white-eyed blowout fracture” (WEBOF). Children may present with a vague history, allow only a limited ocular examination, and be misdiagnosed as having an intracranial injury (e.g., concussion) leading to delay in management of WEBOF. Be aware of the oculocardiac reflex (nausea or vomiting, bradycardia, syncope, dehydration) that can accompany entrapment. Even in cases where correct orbital imaging is performed, CT evidence of an orbital fracture may be minimal and routinely missed. Careful examination of coronal and parasagittal views is critical in such cases. In typical (i.e., non-WEBOF) orbital fractures, forced duction testing or testing of the doll’s eye reflex may be performed if limitation of eye movement persists beyond 1 week and restriction is suspected. In the early phase, it is often difficult to distinguish soft tissue edema or contusion from soft tissue entrapment in the fracture.

Depending on the timing of the cantholysis in relation to the hemorrhage, vision may dramatically improve. Superior cantholysis is usually unnecessary: cadaver studies have not shown a dramatic decrease in intraorbital pressure with superior cantholysis.

Always remember that an RAPD may indicate asymmetric, bilateral TON; resist any reassurances to the patient’s family of normal contralateral visual function in obtunded or uncooperative patients with an RAPD. Anecdotally, mild to moderate posterior indirect TON may show significant spontaneous improvement over 3 to 6 months in 30% to 60% of patients, while severe initial visual loss seems to carry a worse prognosis."

If unsuccessful or disease requires >7.5 to 10 mg prednisone/day for long-term control, immunosuppressive therapy is indicated.\nIntravenous steroids: Methylprednisolone succinate 1,000 mg daily for 3 days (followed by oral steroids as above) is preferable to prednisone >80 mg/d because of reduced risk of ischemic necrosis of bone.\nImmunosuppressive therapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, anti-TNFα agents, and other biologics): If one drug is ineffective or not tolerated, additional agents should be tried. Systemic steroids may be used in conjunction. Immunosuppressive therapy should be coordinated with an internist, rheumatologist, or uveitis specialist. Topical cyclosporine is rarely effective.\nConventional teaching is that topical therapy is of little benefit. However, difluprednate 0.05% drops are sometimes helpful (with or without a topical NSAID) and thus, in mild cases, may spare the need for systemic immunosuppressive agents.\nSubconjunctival steroid injections (e.g., 0.1 to 0.3 mL of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg/mL or dexamethasone sodium phosphate 4 mg/mL): May be very helpful in patients unable to tolerate systemic therapy. Side effects may include subconjunctival hemorrhage, cataract, glaucoma, and (rarely) catastrophic scleral melting. Do not use in cases of necrotizing scleritis.\n",

Concomitant eyelid, orbital, facial, nasal, or oropharyngeal lymphangiomas can be present. Surgical excision may be performed for cosmetic or functional purposes, but it often must be repeated because it is difficult to remove the entire tumor with one surgical procedure. Sclerotherapy, in which intralesional injections of 2 to 4 mg of 1 mg/mL bleomycin are administered every 4 weeks depending on clinical response, can lead to involution and fibrosis of the lesion.

Other experts question the long-term efficacy of this regimen. Periorbital corticosteroid injections are also used by some experts, but may be suboptimal to oral corticosteroids.

It may be used as a modality in the acute inflammatory phase of TED or as a means to limit progression and provide long-term control. Radiation therapy appears to decrease the severity and progression of restrictive strabismus in patients with active TED; efficacy in managing other aspects of TED (including optic neuropathy) has not been proved definitively, but is advocated by some experts. Radiation therapy should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, as it may worsen diabetic retinopathy, and in vasculopaths, as it may increase the risk of radiation retinopathy or optic neuropathy, although neither of these risks have been proven definitively. All patients offered radiation therapy should be informed of the potential risks. If used, radiation is best performed according to strict protocols with carefully controlled dosage and shielding under the supervision of a radiation oncologist familiar with the technique. Typically, a total dose of 20 Gy is administered in 10 to 14 fractions over 2 weeks. Treatment may transiently exacerbate inflammatory changes and an oral prednisone taper may mitigate these symptoms. Improvement is often seen within a few weeks of treatment, but may take several months to attain the maximal effect.",

It is reasonable to offer this therapy to women with mild-to-moderate, active TED at a dose of 100 μg p.o. b.i.d for 6 months. Caution should be used in the use of selenium supplementation in men, especially with a family history of prostate cancer; some studies have suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer in males with high selenium levels, although this issue does not appear to have been settled conclusively.",

Their use as primary therapy in lieu of more conventional modalities is, at present, off-label and controversial. Furthermore, there appears to be little consensus as to the most effective, specific biologic target in TED. Recently, the use of teprotumumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) has shown promise in the management of TED. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in TED patients in January 2020. For patients with moderate to severe TED, the drug is effective in decreasing exophthalmos and diplopia.",
            "Visual loss from optic neuropathy: Treat immediately with prednisone 1 mg/kg/d with close monitoring. In cases of severe visual loss, admission for pulsed intravenous therapy may be indicated. Radiation therapy may be offered for mild-to-moderate optic neuropathy, with the understanding that there is typically a lag in the treatment effect. Posterior orbital decompression surgery (for mild-to-severe optic neuropathy), either medial or lateral, is essential and usually effective in rapidly reversing or stabilizing the optic neuropathy. Anterior orbital decompression is usually ineffective in treating TED optic neuropathy. Teprotumumab has also been shown to effectively manage optic neuropathy in TED based on small series of patients."

Bony erosion is very rare in IOIS and warrants further workup. Orbital MRI with contrast and fat suppression: May show EOM enlargement, infiltration of orbital fat, enlargement of the lacrimal gland, thickening of posterior Tenon/sclera, and enhancement along the optic nerve (perineuritis).

Side effects of propranolol include hypoglycemia, hypotension, and bradycardia. Asthmatics and those with reactive airway disease are at risk for bronchospasm. Therefore, patients should be evaluated by a pediatrician pretreatment and monitored throughout the course of treatment. The initial dose of ß-blocker is typically given in conjunction with cardiopulmonary monitoring. Note that not all lesions respond to this therapy.\nOral corticosteroids: Used less frequently since the introduction of ß-blockers. The dose is 2 to 3 mg/kg, tapered over 6 weeks. IOP must be monitored, and patients should be placed on GI prophylaxis.\nA local corticosteroid injection (e.g., betamethasone 6 mg/mL and triamcinolone 40 mg/mL) is seldom used. Care should be taken to avoid orbital hemorrhage and central retinal artery occlusion during injection. Skin atrophy and depigmentation are other potential complications. Note that periocular injection of triamcinolone is contraindicated by the manufacturer because of the potential risk of embolic infarction. See note in 6.2, Chalazion/Hordeolum.\nSurgical excision: If the hemangioma is circumscribed and accessible, excision can be performed effectively and is often curative.\nInterferon therapy: Usually reserved for large or systemic lesions that may be associated with a consumptive coagulopathy or high-output congestive heart failure (Kasabach–Merritt syndrome). There is a risk of spastic diplegia with this therapy. No longer used except in rare cases because of other viable alternatives, including propranolol.\n",

Middle-aged women most commonly affected, with a slow onset of orbital signs. Growth may accelerate during pregnancy (see Figure 7.4.2.1).\nMesenchymal tumors: Orbital lesions with varying degrees of aggressive behavior. The largest group is now labeled solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) and includes fibrous histiocytoma and hemangiopericytoma. These lesions cannot be distinguished clinically or radiographically. May occur at any age. Immunohistochemical staining for STAT6 is usually diagnostic.\nNeurilemmoma (schwannoma): Progressive, painless proptosis. Rarely associated with neurofibromatosis type II. Malignant schwannoma has been reported but is rare.\nNeurofibroma: See 7.4.1, Orbital Tumors in Children.\nMeningioma: Optic nerve sheath meningioma (ONSM) typically occurs in middle-aged women with painless, slowly progressive visual loss, often with mild proptosis. An afferent pupillary defect may be present. Ophthalmoscopy can reveal optic nerve swelling, optic atrophy, or abnormal collateral vessels around the optic nerve head (optociliary shunts).\nOther optic nerve lesions: Optic nerve glioma, optic nerve sarcoid, malignant optic nerve glioma of adulthood (MOGA). The second most common lesion of the optic nerve (excluding optic neuritis) after ONSM is optic nerve sarcoid, which may be difficult to distinguish from ONSM clinically and radiologically. The ACE level may be normal in cases of isolated optic nerve sarcoid. MOGA is a rapidly progressive optic nerve lesion of the elderly akin to glioblastoma multiforme; it carries a poor prognosis and is often misdiagnosed as a “progressive NAION.”\nLymphangioma: Usually discovered in childhood. See 7.4.1, Orbital Tumors in Children.\n",

Usually located nasally or superonasally, emanating from the frontal and ethmoid sinuses.

Some have neurofibromatosis type I, but most do not.\nSPA or spontaneous hematoma: See 7.3.2, Subperiosteal Abscess.\nDermoid cyst: See 7.4.1, Orbital Tumors in Children.\nOthers: Tumors of the lacrimal gland (pleomorphic adenoma [well circumscribed], adenoid cystic carcinoma [ACC] [variably circumscribed with adjacent bone destruction]), sphenoid wing meningioma (commonly occurring in middle-aged females and a cause of compressive optic neuropathy), secondary tumors extending from the brain or paranasal sinuses, primary osseous tumors, and vascular lesions (e.g., varix and arteriovenous malformation including CCF).\n",
          "Intraconal or extraconal: \nLymphoproliferative disease (lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoma): More commonly extraconal. About 50% are well circumscribed on imaging, and 50% are infiltrative. Ocular adnexal lymphoma is typically of the non-Hodgkin B-cell type (NHL), and about 75% to 85% follow an indolent course (extranodal marginal zone lymphoma [EMZL] or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, grade I or II follicular cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [small cell lymphoma]). The remainder are aggressive lesions (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, among others). May occur at any adult age; orbital NHL is rare in children. Slow onset and progression unless there is an aggressive subtype. Pain may occur in up to 25% of orbital NHL. Typically develops superiorly in the anterior aspect of the orbit, with about 50% occurring in the lacrimal gland. May be accompanied by a subconjunctival salmon-colored lesion. Most orbital NHL (especially if indolent subtype) occurs without evidence of systemic lymphoma (Stage IE). Orbital NHL may be confused with IOIS, especially when it presents more acutely with pain. Note that NHL frequently responds dramatically to systemic corticosteroids, as does IOIS.\nMetastases: Usually occurs in middle-aged to elderly people with a variable onset of orbital signs. Common primary sources include the breast (most common in women), lung (most common in men), and genitourinary tract (especially prostate). Twenty percent of orbital breast cancer metastases are bilateral and frequently involve extraocular muscles. Enophthalmos (not proptosis) may be seen with scirrhous breast carcinoma. Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma has a propensity for bone and often involves the zygoma or greater sphenoid wing. Note that uveal metastases are far more common than orbital lesions by a 10 to 1 ratio.\nOthers: Mesenchymal tumors and other malignancies.\n"

          "Lymphoid tumors: Lymphoid hyperplasia and indolent lymphoma without systemic involvement are treated almost identically. With few exceptions, orbital lymphoproliferations respond dramatically to relatively low doses of radiation (∼24 Gy); ocular and optic nerve complications are therefore less common than with other malignancies. Systemic lymphoma or localized aggressive lymphoma are treated with chemotherapy and in many cases with biologics (e.g., rituximab). The vast majority of orbital lymphoma is of B-cell origin and 50% to 60% are EMZL. In older individuals with few symptoms and indolent lesions, more conservative measures may be indicated, including observation alone or brief courses of corticosteroids. To date, there is no clear role for the use of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of orbital lymphoproliferative disease except possibly in certain geographic locations. There is also no clear evidence that orbital EMZL is in any way related to Helicobacter pylori -associated gastric EMZL. Remember that the specific subtype of NHL (and therefore level of aggressiveness) and stage of the disease define the ultimate treatment.",
          "ONSM: The diagnosis is usually based on slow progression and typical MRI findings. MRI with gadolinium is the preferred imaging modality. CT is occasionally helpful in demonstrating intralesional calcifications. Stereotactic radiation therapy is usually indicated when the tumor is growing and causing significant visual loss. Otherwise, the patient may be followed every 3 to 6 months with serial clinical examinations and imaging studies as needed. Recent studies have shown the significant efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy in decreasing tumor growth and in visual preservation. Stereotactic radiotherapy is not equivalent to gamma knife therapy (“radiosurgery”). Empiric stereotactic radiotherapy (i.e., without confirmatory biopsy) is a reasonable treatment option, but is reserved for typical cases of ONSM.

A bruit is sometimes heard by the patient and may be detected if ocular auscultation is performed. Pulsating proptosis, arterialized “corkscrew” conjunctival vessels, increased IOP, retinal venous congestion, and chemosis may be present. May mimic an orbital disease, including TED and IOIS. In the early stages, often misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis, asymmetric glaucoma, etc. CT scan reveals enlarged superior ophthalmic vein(s), sometimes accompanied by enlarged extraocular muscles. An orbital color Doppler US shows reversed, arterialized flow in the superior ophthalmic vein(s). MRA or CTA may reveal AVF but a definitive diagnosis usually requires cerebral arteriography. Evidence of posterior cortical venous outflow on arteriography increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Of note, posterior cortical venous outflow is more common in patients with bilateral orbital signs, but is seen in 10% of patients with unilateral presentation. Also remember that arteriography must be performed on both cerebral hemispheres and include the internal carotid, external carotid, and basilar arteries (“six vessel angio”). The cavernous sinuses are connected by the circular sinus and, on occasion, a carotid–cavernous fistula manifests clinically in the contralateral orbit.",
        "Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: Orbital cellulitis signs, plus dilated and sluggish pupils as well as palsies of the third, fourth, fifth, and/or sixth cranial nerves out of proportion to the degree of orbital edema. Decreasing level of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, and fevers can occur. May be bilateral with rapid progression. See 7.3.1, O rbital C ellulitis .",

Of note, cANCA may be normal in two-third of patients with the limited sino-orbital variant of GPA.",
        "Varix: A large, dilated vein in the orbit that produces proptosis when it fills and dilates (e.g., during a Valsalva maneuver or with the head in a dependent position). When the vein is not engorged, the proptosis disappears. CT demonstrates the dilated vein if an enhanced scan is performed during a Valsalva maneuver. Calcification may be seen in long-standing lesions.",
        "Poorly understood processes: \nTolosa–Hunt syndrome (THS): NOT equivalent to orbital apical IOIS. Histopathologically, a granulomatous inflammation of the orbital apex and/or carotid siphon within the cavernous sinus. Presents with acute pain, cranial neuropathy, and sometimes proptosis. A diagnosis of exclusion. Difficult to diagnose with CT. MRI shows isolated, ipsilateral enlargement of the cavernous sinus. Usually sensitive to corticosteroid therapy, but pain typically responds much more quickly than external ophthalmoplegia, which may take weeks to resolve. Because confirmatory biopsy is usually not feasible, every patient with presumed THS must be followed long-term, even after rapid response to corticosteroids, to rule out other etiologies. Repeat imaging is usually indicated several months after the initial event to rule out progression. Presumed THS recurs in about one-third of patients. Remember that other significant pathologies, including sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastasis, and even aneurysm may show a temporary response to corticosteroids.\nSclerosing orbital pseudotumor: Likely not a true orbital inflammation or a subtype of IOIS. May be a form of idiopathic multifocal sclerosis. Presents with chronic pain, external ophthalmoplegia, and possibly optic neuropathy. Diagnosis requires biopsy. Histopathology shows wide swaths of monotonous fibrous tissue interspersed with mild inflammation. Treatment is difficult and may necessitate antimetabolite therapy, debulking, and in severe cases, exenteration.\nOrbital amyloid: May be primary (isolated) or secondary to systemic disease. All patients require a systemic workup, including a cardiology consult to rule out cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is made by judicious orbital biopsy (this lesion is highly vascular and hemostasis is often difficult to obtain). Treatment is highly variable.\n"

If vision does not improve, the effect of the atropine can be increased by removing the hyperopic lens from the glasses of the nonamblyopic eye.

Examination after pupil dilatation may reveal a plaque of fibrovascular tissue behind the lens with elongated ciliary processes extending to it. Progression of the lens opacity often leads to angle-closure glaucoma. If bilateral, 90% are associated with systemic abnormalities and require further workup.\nRubella: “Pearly white” nuclear cataract, “salt-and-pepper” chorioretinitis, microphthalmos, corneal clouding, and poorly dilating pupils.

    "9.12.3 Phacoantigenic Glaucoma (Formerly PHACOANAPHYLAXIS)": [
      "Formerly known as “phacoanaphylaxis,” this rare condition presents with chronic granulomatous uveitis in response to prior sensitization of lens material liberated by trauma or intraocular surgery. It may have associated glaucomatous optic neuropathy, although this is rare at presentation. After lens material is liberated, there is a latent period where an immune sensitivity develops. Inflammatory cells surround lens material, and glaucoma may result from blockage of the TM by these cells and lens particles. Other forms of uveitis should be considered, including sympathetic ophthalmia. Other forms of lens-induced glaucoma must be considered including lens particle and phacolytic glaucoma. Treatment is with topical steroids and antiglaucoma medications. The lens should be removed surgically, particularly if IOP or inflammation cannot be adequately controlled with medications."

    "9.12.4 Phacomorphic Glaucoma": [
      [
        "Phacomorphic glaucoma is caused by closure of the anterior chamber angle by a large intumescent cataract. A pupillary block mechanism may play a role. The initial treatment includes topical antiglaucoma medication(s), although a systemic CAI and hyperosmotic agent may be necessary as well (see 9.4, A",

      [
        "Lens dislocation/subluxation may be caused by trauma, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or congenital zonular dysgenesis (e.g., Marfan syndrome, spherophakia). Mechanisms for glaucoma in dislocated/subluxed lenses include an inflammatory reaction caused by the lens material itself, pupillary block, or damage to the anterior chamber angle sustained during trauma. A dislocated lens may become hypermature and cause a phacolytic glaucoma (see 9.12.1, P",
        "hacolytic",
        "G",
        "laucoma",

Treatment is aimed at relieving the pupillary block. Iridectomy is usually indicated and necessary to prevent future attacks. Cycloplegics are helpful along with face up/supine head positioning to allow lens to fall back. IOP-lowering medications are employed. Avoid miotics.

Systemic steroid therapy in children may cause growth suppression and should be avoided if possible. Prolonged cycloplegic therapy may be required and necessitate appropriate refractive correction. Consultation with rheumatology, pediatrics, and/or a uveitis specialist is useful as immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., methotrexate, adalimumab, and infliximab) is often needed.

Avoid cataract surgery if possible until the patient is inflammation-free for at least 3 months. An IOL may be placed in select circumstances and is preferable to aphakia in well-controlled disease.\n\nChronic iridocyclitis of children: Same as JIA.\nFHIC: Usually does not respond to or require steroids (a trial of steroids may be attempted, but they should be tapered quickly if there is no response); cycloplegics are not necessary.\n\n NOTE: Patients with FHIC usually do well with cataract surgery; however, they may develop a hyphema.\n\nSarcoidosis: See 12.6, Sarcoidosis.\nSyphilis: See 12.12, Syphilis.\nTuberculosis: Refer the patient to an internist, infectious disease specialist, or public health officer for consideration of systemic treatment.

See 12.13, Postoperative Endophthalmitis.\nRetained lens material: A severe granulomatous inflammation with mutton-fat KP, resulting from an hypersensitivity reaction to lens protein exposed during surgery and may result in elevated IOP. See 9.12, Lens-Related Glaucoma.\nAseptic (sterile) endophthalmitis: A severe noninfectious postoperative uveitis caused by intraoperative injections (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide) or excess tissue manipulation, especially of vitreous manipulation, during surgery. A hypopyon and a mild vitreous cellular reaction may develop. Usually not characterized by profound or progressive pain or visual loss. A fibrinoid reaction is typically absent. Eyelid swelling and chemosis are atypical. Conjunctival injection is often absent. Usually resolves with topical steroid therapy.\nTASS: An acute, sterile inflammation following uneventful surgery that develops rapidly within 6 to 24 hours. Characterized by anterior chamber cell and flare, possibly with fibrin or hypopyon, and severe corneal edema in excess of what would be expected following surgery. IOP may be increased. May be caused by any material placed in the eye during surgery including irrigating or injected solutions (e.g., due to the presence of a preservative or incorrect pH or concentration of a solution) or improperly cleaned instruments.\nAcute iridocyclitis flare: HLA-B27-associated and herpetic uveitis flares can be triggered by surgical trauma.\n",
          "Persistent postoperative inflammation (e.g., beyond 6 weeks): \nPoor compliance with topical steroids.\nSteroid drops tapered too rapidly.\nRetained lens material.\nIris or vitreous incarceration in the wound.\nUGH syndrome: Irritation of the iris or ciliary body by an IOL. Increased IOP and red blood cells in the anterior chamber accompany the anterior segment inflammation. See 9.16, Postoperative Glaucoma.\nRetinal detachment: Often produces a low-grade anterior chamber reaction. See 11.3, Retinal Detachment.\nSub-acute endophthalmitis (e.g., C. acnes and other indolent bacteria, fungal, or partially treated bacterial endophthalmitis).\nEpithelial downgrowth: Corneal or conjunctival epithelium grows into the eye through a corneal wound and may be seen on the posterior corneal surface and iris. The iris may appear flattened with loss of detail because of the spread of the membrane across the anterior chamber angle onto the iris. Large cells may be seen in the anterior chamber, and glaucoma may be present. The diagnosis of epithelial downgrowth can be confirmed by observing the immediate appearance of white spots after medium-power argon laser treatment to the areas of iris covered by the membrane. An anterior chamber tap may also reveal many epithelial cells.\nPreexisting chronic uveitis: See 12.1, Anterior Uveitis (Iritis/Iridocyclitis).\nSympathetic ophthalmia: Diffuse granulomatous inflammation in both eyes, after penetrating trauma or surgery. See 12.18, Sympathetic Ophthalmia.\n"

In this manner, OCT is similar to US except that OCT is based on the reflection of light, not sound. The OCT scanner sends low-coherence light (∼820-nm wavelength for posterior segment imaging and ∼1310-nm wavelength for anterior segment imaging) emitted by a superluminescent diode to the tissue to be examined and to a reference beam. The time delays of the light reflections from retinal structures are recorded by an interferometer. Using a reference mirror, these light reflections are then translated into an imaged object with a high resolution of up to 3 microns. The most highly reflective structures are the nerve fiber layer and the RPE. Highly reflective lesions include dense pigmentation, scar tissue, subhyaloid hemorrhage, and hard exudates. Low reflectivity in pathologic conditions include intraretinal or subretinal fluid.",
