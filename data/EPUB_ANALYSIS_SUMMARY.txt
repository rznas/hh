🔑 KEY PREPARATION TASKS FOR GRAPHRAG
================================================================================

PHASE 1: CONTENT EXTRACTION
  ☐ Parse all chapter content into structured JSON
  ☐ Extract section hierarchies (headings)
  ☐ Extract and normalize 21 tables
  ☐ Extract and structure 1,086 lists
  ☐ Create image metadata (522 images)

PHASE 2: ENTITY EXTRACTION
  ☐ Extract disease entities (100+ diseases expected)
  ☐ Extract symptom entities (50+ symptoms expected)
  ☐ Extract sign entities (30+ signs expected)
  ☐ Extract treatment/procedure entities
  ☐ Assign medical codes (ICD-10, SNOMED CT)

PHASE 3: RELATIONSHIP EXTRACTION
  ☐ Disease → Symptoms (presents_with)
  ☐ Disease → Signs (associated_with)
  ☐ Disease → Treatments (treated_with)
  ☐ Symptom/Sign → Differential Diagnoses (suggests)
  ☐ Treatment → Contraindications (contraindicated_with)
  ☐ Disease → Complications (can_cause)

PHASE 4: DOMAIN STANDARDIZATION
  ☐ Map to ICD-10 codes
  ☐ Map to SNOMED CT codes
  ☐ Assign urgency levels (Emergent/Urgent/Non-urgent)
  ☐ Extract red flags for triage
  ☐ Create disease hierarchies

PHASE 5: VALIDATION
  ☐ Validate entity extraction
  ☐ Validate relationship accuracy
  ☐ Verify medical accuracy (critical!)
  ☐ Confirm 100% red flag detection (no false negatives)
  ☐ Test triage recommendations

PHASE 6: GRAPH PREPARATION
  ☐ Convert to Neo4j node format
  ☐ Convert to Neo4j relationship format
  ☐ Generate Neo4j Cypher import script
  ☐ Prepare for knowledge graph indexing

💡 INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. CONTENT COMPLEXITY:
   - High variability in content types (text, tables, lists, images)
   - Deep hierarchies (up to 6 heading levels in some chapters)
   - Significant medical detail requiring careful extraction

2. MEDICAL DOMAIN:
   - 14 specialized ophthalmology topics
   - Comprehensive differential diagnosis coverage
   - Strong emphasis on triage-critical information (red flags, urgency)

3. GRAPHRAG READINESS:
   ✓ Sufficient content for knowledge graph (100+ entities expected)
   ✓ Strong relationship structure (DDx, treatments, procedures)
   ✓ Tables provide structured medical information
   ✓ Chapter hierarchy provides natural organization

4. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
   HIGH: Phases 1-3 (Content + Entity + Relationship extraction)
   HIGH: Phase 5.1 (Red flag extraction - critical for triage)
   HIGH: Phase 4.2 (Urgency classification - medical safety)
   MEDIUM: Phases 4, 6, 7 (Standardization, graph prep, validation)
   LOW: Phase 1.4 (Image processing)

5. ESTIMATED EFFORT:
   - Total: 124-178 hours
   - Critical path: 80-100 hours (Phases 1-3, 5.1, 4.2)
   - Can parallelize: Phases 3-5 after Phase 2 complete

6. RISK FACTORS:
   ⚠ Medical accuracy validation required (safety-critical)
   ⚠ Red flag extraction must have 100% recall (no false negatives)
   ⚠ Cross-references between chapters need careful mapping
   ⚠ Terminology standardization requires medical domain expertise

7. SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   ✓ All 100+ diseases extracted with correct urgency levels
   ✓ All red flags identified (100% recall)
   ✓ Symptom → Disease differential mapping complete
   ✓ Treatment protocols extracted for each disease
   ✓ Neo4j import successful with all relationships validated
   ✓ Triage recommendations match medical standards
