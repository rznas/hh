# Migration from Zep Graphiti to Microsoft GraphRAG

## Executive Summary

We are migrating from **Zep Graphiti** to **Microsoft GraphRAG** for our medical triage knowledge graph. This decision is based on better alignment with structured medical knowledge, hierarchical search capabilities, and improved domain optimization.

**Migration Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress (40% complete)

## Why Migrate?

### Limitations of Zep Graphiti
- **Episode-based model**: Designed for narrative/temporal data, not structured medical knowledge
- **Flat structure**: No hierarchical organization of medical conditions
- **Single search mode**: Only semantic search, no community-based queries
- **Limited explainability**: Difficult to trace reasoning through relationships

### Advantages of Microsoft GraphRAG
- âœ… **Hierarchical communities**: Natural grouping of related conditions (trauma, infections, glaucoma, etc.)
- âœ… **Dual search modes**: Local (entity-specific) + Global (broad thematic queries)
- âœ… **Better medical fit**: Entity-relationship model aligns with medical knowledge
- âœ… **Cost efficiency**: Pre-computed community summaries reduce LLM calls
- âœ… **Enhanced explainability**: Can trace reasoning through graph structure
- âœ… **Domain optimization**: Support for medical-specific embeddings (BioBERT)

| **Knowledge Addition** | Episode-based | Entity extraction |
| **Graph Structure** | Flat, temporal | Hierarchical communities |
| **Search Modes** | Semantic only | Local + Global |
| **Summarization** | None | Multi-level community summaries |
| **Best For** | Narrative/temporal data | Structured knowledge domains |
| **Medical Fit** | Poor | Excellent |
| **Cost per Query** | Higher (more LLM calls) | Lower (cached summaries) |
| **Explainability** | Limited | High (graph traversal) |

## Backward Compatibility

### API Compatibility
The new `GraphRAGClient` will maintain the same interface as `GraphitiClient`:
```python
# Old (Graphiti)
from graphiti_client import GraphitiClient
client = GraphitiClient()
results = await client.search("sudden vision loss")

# New (GraphRAG) - Same interface!
from graphrag_client import GraphRAGClient
client = GraphRAGClient()
results = await client.search("sudden vision loss")
```

### Data Migration
- Existing Graphiti data can be exported
- New GraphRAG indexing will process Wills Eye Manual from source
- No data loss - both systems can coexist during transition

## Testing Strategy
