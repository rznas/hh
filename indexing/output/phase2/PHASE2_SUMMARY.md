# Phase 2: Medical Entity Extraction - Summary Report

## Overview
Successfully extracted medical entities from The Wills Eye Manual using Phase 1 structured data (text blocks, lists, tables). Entities are ready for relationship extraction (Phase 3) and GraphRAG indexing.

## Execution Details
- **Date**: October 22, 2025
- **Source Data**: Phase 1 output (609 text blocks, 313 lists)
- **Chapters Covered**: 1-5
- **Extraction Method**: Rule-based pattern matching + list analysis
- **Status**: ✅ Phase 2 Complete (Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)

## Deliverables

### 2.1 Disease Entities
**Output**: `diseases.json` (395 entities)

**Extraction Sources:**
- Text blocks: Pattern matching for disease suffixes (-itis, -oma, -opathy, etc.)
- Differential diagnosis lists: 48 lists (high confidence source)
- Known disease seed list: Validated against medical terminology

**Statistics:**
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Diseases** | 395 |
| **Emergent (Red Flag)** | 109 |
| **Urgent** | 286 |
| **From DDx Lists** | 362 |
| **From Section Headings** | Various |

**Severity Distribution:**
- **Emergent**: 109 (27.6%) - Primarily from Chapter 3 (Trauma)
- **Urgent**: 286 (72.4%) - Primarily from Chapters 4-5 (Cornea, Conjunctiva)

**Sample Entities:**
```json
{
  "entity_id": "disease_001",
  "name": "Keratitis",
  "name_normalized": "keratitis",
  "severity": "urgent",
  "red_flag": true,
  "chapters": [4],
  "from_differential_diagnosis": true,
  "mention_count": 15
}
```

**Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ 91.6% from differential diagnosis lists (high confidence)
- ✅ Red flags identified based on Chapter 3 (Trauma) presence
- ✅ Severity mapped based on chapter context
- ⚠️ Synonyms not yet populated (Phase 4)
- ⚠️ ICD-10/SNOMED codes not yet mapped (Phase 4)

### 2.2 Symptom & Sign Entities
**Output**: `symptoms.json` (5 entities), `signs.json` (9 entities)

**Extraction Sources:**
- Chapter 1 (Differential Diagnosis of Ocular Symptoms) - Patient-reported
- Chapter 2 (Differential Diagnosis of Ocular Signs) - Clinician-observed
- List section headings from Chapters 1 & 2

**Statistics:**
| Metric | Symptoms | Signs |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Total Entities** | 5 | 9 |
| **Red Flags** | 0 | 0 |
| **With Associated Conditions** | 5 | 9 |

**Symptoms Extracted:**
1. Double Vision (Diplopia)
2. Pain
3. Photophobia
4. Spots/Floaters
5. Vision Loss/Blurred Vision

**Signs Extracted:**
1. Abnormal Pupil
2. Anterior Chamber Abnormality
3. Corneal Opacity
4. Eyelid Abnormality
5. Injection/Redness
6. Nystagmus
7. Optic Disc Abnormality
8. Proptosis
9. Vitreous Abnormality

**Sample Entity:**
```json
{
  "entity_id": "symptom_001",
  "name": "Pain",
  "name_normalized": "pain",
  "type": "symptom",
  "category": "ocular",
  "red_flag": false,
  "chapter": 1,
  "associated_conditions": ["Dry eye", "Keratitis", "Uveitis", ...]
}
```

**Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ Clear distinction between symptoms (patient) and signs (clinician)
- ✅ Associated conditions extracted from differential diagnosis lists
- ⚠️ Limited to section headings in lists (hierarchy issue from Phase 1)
- ⚠️ Red flag detection could be improved with keyword analysis

**Extraction Sources:**
- Medication lists: 57 lists
- Treatment lists: 143 lists
- Procedure lists: 10 lists

**Statistics:**
| Type | Count | Percentage |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Medications** | 48 | 72.7% |
| **Procedures** | 18 | 27.3% |
| **Total** | 66 | 100% |

**Medication Classes Identified:**
- Antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tobramycin, etc.)
- Corticosteroids (prednisolone, dexamethasone)
- Antiglaucoma (timolol, latanoprost, brimonidine)
- Cycloplegics/Mydriatics
- Lubricants/Artificial Tears
- Antivirals, Antifungals

**Procedures Identified:**
- Laser procedures (photocoagulation, iridotomy, capsulotomy)
- Surgical (vitrectomy, keratoplasty, trabeculectomy, repair)
- Diagnostic (culture, scraping, biopsy)
- Therapeutic (debridement, irrigation, drainage)

**Sample Entity:**
```json
{
  "entity_id": "treatment_015",
  "name": "Prednisolone",
  "name_normalized": "prednisolone",
  "type": "medication",
  "category": "pharmacological",
  "chapters": [3, 4, 5],
  "mention_count": 12
}
```

**Quality Indicators:**
- ✅ Pattern-based extraction for dosing information
- ✅ Classification into medication vs. procedure
- ✅ Filtered by mention frequency (≥2 for medications)
- ⚠️ Dosing information not yet structured (needs Phase 4)
- ⚠️ Drug classes not yet categorized

## Overall Statistics

| Entity Type | Count | Primary Source |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| **Diseases** | 395 | DDx lists, text patterns |
| **Symptoms** | 5 | Chapter 1 headings |
| **Signs** | 9 | Chapter 2 headings |
| **Treatments** | 66 | Medication/treatment lists |
| **TOTAL** | 475 | Phase 1 data |

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. ✅ **High Confidence Diseases**: 91.6% from differential diagnosis lists
2. ✅ **Clear Entity Types**: Symptoms vs. signs vs. diseases distinction
3. ✅ **Red Flag Identification**: 109 emergent conditions identified
4. ✅ **Chapter Context Preserved**: All entities linked to source chapters
5. ✅ **Mention Tracking**: Frequency counts enable confidence scoring

### Limitations
1. ⚠️ **Limited Symptoms/Signs**: Only 14 total (hierarchy issue from Phase 1)
   - Chapter 1 & 2 section headings not fully captured
   - Could extract more from text block analysis
2. ⚠️ **No Synonyms Yet**: Disease name variations not mapped
3. ⚠️ **No Standard Codes**: ICD-10/SNOMED mapping deferred to Phase 4
4. ⚠️ **Pattern-Based Limitations**: May miss non-standard disease names
5. ⚠️ **Dosing Not Structured**: Medication dosing in free text

## Next Steps for Phase 3

**Ready for Relationship Extraction:**
1. ✅ **Disease → Symptom** ("presents_with"): 395 diseases × symptoms
2. ✅ **Disease → Sign** ("associated_with"): 395 diseases × signs
3. ✅ **Disease → Treatment** ("treated_with"): 395 diseases × 66 treatments
4. ✅ **Symptom → Disease** ("differential_diagnosis"): Use DDx lists
5. ✅ **Disease → Disease** ("complication_of", "can_cause")

**Recommendations:**
- Extract relationships from treatment lists (Chapter 3-5)
- Map symptoms/signs to diseases using associated_conditions
- Use tables for structured disease-treatment mappings
- Identify contraindications from safety warnings

## Usage Examples

### Load all entities
```python
import json

with open('diseases.json') as f:
    diseases = json.load(f)

with open('symptoms.json') as f:
    symptoms = json.load(f)

with open('treatments.json') as f:
    treatments = json.load(f)

print(f"Total entities: {len(diseases) + len(symptoms) + len(treatments)}")
```

### Find red flag diseases
```python
red_flags = [d for d in diseases if d['red_flag']]
print(f"Red flag conditions: {len(red_flags)}")
```

### Find medications for a disease
```python
# This will be possible after Phase 3 relationship extraction
```

## Validation

### Manual Spot Checks
- ✅ Common diseases identified (keratitis, conjunctivitis, glaucoma, uveitis)
- ✅ Emergency conditions flagged (trauma-related, chemical burns)
- ✅ Medications match expected ophthalmic drugs
- ✅ Procedures match expected eye surgeries

### Statistical Validation
- ✅ Disease count reasonable for 5 chapters (~80 per chapter)
- ✅ Medication count matches known ophthalmic drug classes
- ✅ Severity distribution makes sense (more urgent than emergent)
