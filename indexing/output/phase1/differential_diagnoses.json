Enhanced ocular pulsation (“pulsatile proptosis”) may occur, usually discernible on slit lamp examination during applanation. A bruit may be heard in high flow fistulas by the physician, and sometimes by the patient, with auscultation around the globe or temple. Reversed, arterialized flow in the superior ophthalmic vein is detectable with orbital color Doppler US. Orbital CT or MRI may show an enlarged superior ophthalmic vein. MRA or CTA may occasionally reveal the fistula, but definitive diagnosis usually requires arteriography. High-flow fistulas have an abrupt onset, often following trauma or rupture of an intracavernous aneurysm. Low-flow fistulas have a more insidious presentation, most commonly in hypertensive women >50 years of age, and are due to dural arteriovenous malformations. The Barrow classification is used for preoperative planning and subdivides carotid–cavernous fistulas as follows:\n\nDirect fistula.\nIndirect with branches solely from internal carotid artery (rare).\nIndirect with branches solely from external carotid artery.\nIndirect with branches from both internal and external carotid arteries (most common).",
