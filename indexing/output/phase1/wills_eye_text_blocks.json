Examine closely for possible entry sites (rule out self-sealing lacerations), pupil irregularities, iris tears and transillumination defects (TIDs), lens capsular perforations, lens opacities, hyphema, AC shallowing (or deepening in scleral perforations), and asymmetrically low IOP in the involved eye.\n\n NOTE: There may be multiple foreign bodies with injuries due to power equipment or explosive debris.\n\nIf there is no evidence of perforation, evert the eyelids and inspect the fornices for additional foreign bodies. Double everting the upper eyelid with a Desmarres eyelid retractor may be necessary. Carefully inspect conjunctival lacerations to rule out an underlying scleral laceration or perforation. Measure and diagram the dimensions of any corneal or scleral infiltrate and the degree of any AC reaction for monitoring therapy response and progression of possible infection.\n\n NOTE: An infiltrate accompanied by a significant AC reaction, purulent discharge, or extreme conjunctival injection and pain should be cultured to rule out infection, treated aggressively with antibiotics, and followed closely (see 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis).; Dilate the eye and examine the posterior segment for possible IOFB (see 3.15, Intraocular Foreign Body).; Consider B-scan ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbit (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views, 1-mm sections), or ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) to exclude an intraocular or intraorbital foreign body. While we prefer a CT scan, a plain film x-ray can also be used to rule out radiodense foreign bodies. Avoid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if there is a history of possible metallic foreign body.",

The most important step is reapproximation of the tarsus along its vertical axis to allow for proper eyelid alignment and healing. Reapproximation of the tarsus at the margin alone will not provide structural integrity to the eyelid; the injured tarsus will splay apart, resulting in eyelid notching (see Figure 3.8.4C).\n\n NOTE: If patient reliability is questionable, use absorbable 6-0 polyglactin sutures (e.g., Vicryl) for every step.; Be careful to avoid deeper, buried subcutaneous sutures that can incorporate the orbital septum, resulting in eyelid tethering. In general, deep sutures should be avoided in the zone between the tarsus and orbital rim (the vertical lengths of the upper and lower tarsi are approximately 10 mm and 5 mm, respectively).; Deep tarsal sutures should be lamellar (partial thickness), especially in the upper eyelid, to avoid penetration through the underlying conjunctiva and subsequent corneal irritation/injury.; If unsure about patient reliability or in patients who will not cooperate for suture removal (e.g., young children, patients with advanced dementia, etc.), use absorbable 6-0 polyglactin suture (e.g., Vicryl) in the eyelid margin instead of nonabsorbable material (e.g., silk).",

(As already noted, in difficult or unreliable patients, use absorbable suture material only.) Put the suture on traction with a hemostat to ensure good reapproximation of the splayed tarsus and gray line. Leave the suture untied.\n\n NOTE: This marginal suture provides no structural integrity to the eyelid; its main function is to align the eyelid margin anatomy to ensure a good cosmetic repair.; Realign the tarsal edges with interrupted sutures placed through an anterior approach (e.g., 5-0 or 6-0 Vicryl on a spatulated needle). This is the most important structural step in marginal laceration closure. In the upper eyelid, three sutures can usually be placed. In the lower eyelid, two sutures are typically the maximum. A single tarsal suture, in addition to the marginal suture, may be adequate for appropriate tarsal realignment depending on the height of the laceration. Failure to reapproximate the tarsus along its entire vertical length will result in eyelid splaying and notching.; Tie down and trim the tarsal sutures. Tie down the marginal silk suture leaving long tails.; Place and tie another 6-0 silk marginal suture either anterior or posterior to the gray-line suture, again leaving long tails. The posterior suture is often unnecessary, and its absence may decrease the risk of postoperative corneal abrasion. When placing marginal sutures, attempt to realign the normal eyelid anatomy (lash line, meibomian glands, gray line).; Use interrupted 6-0 plain gut sutures to close the skin along the length of the laceration.

Evaluate the globe carefully for an apparent or occult rupture, hyphema or microhyphema, traumatic iritis, and retinal or choroidal damage. A full, dilated examination may be difficult in uncooperative patients with periocular edema but is extremely important in the management of orbital fractures.

White arrow, entrapped orbital soft tissue; red arrows, orbital floor fracture.\n\n\n\n NOTE: It is of paramount importance to rule out intraocular and optic nerve injury as quickly as possible in ALL patients presenting with suspected orbital fracture.\n\n\n NOTE:Pediatric patients are particularly at risk for a unique type of blowout injury: the “trapdoor” fracture. Because pediatric bones lack complete calcification, they tend to “greenstick” rather than completely fracture. This results in an initial fracture, herniation of orbital soft tissue (including EOM) through the fracture site, and rapid snapping back of the malleable bone akin to a trapdoor on a spring. Because of the tight reapposition of the fracture edges, the soft tissue trapped within the fracture becomes ischemic. Children with this type of fracture often have a remarkably benign external periocular appearance but significant EOM restriction (usually vertical) on examination; this constellation of findings has been dubbed the “white-eyed blowout fracture” (WEBOF). Children may present with a vague history, allow only a limited ocular examination, and be misdiagnosed as having an intracranial injury (e.g., concussion) leading to delay in management of WEBOF. Be aware of the oculocardiac reflex (nausea or vomiting, bradycardia, syncope, dehydration) that can accompany entrapment. Even in cases where correct orbital imaging is performed, CT evidence of an orbital fracture may be minimal and routinely missed. Careful examination of coronal and parasagittal views is critical in such cases.\nIn typical (i.e., non-WEBOF) orbital fractures, forced duction testing or testing of the doll’s eye reflex may be performed if limitation of eye movement persists beyond 1 week and restriction is suspected. In the early phase, it is often difficult to distinguish soft tissue edema or contusion from soft tissue entrapment in the fracture. See Appendix 6, Forced Duction Test and Active Force Generation Test.; CT of the orbit and midface (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views, 1- to 1.5-mm sections, without contrast) is obtained in all cases of suspected orbital fractures. Bone windows are especially helpful in fracture evaluation (see Figures 3.9.2 and 3.9.3), including the narrow, oft-missed WEBOF. Inclusion of the midfacial skeleton is mandatory to rule out zygomatic complex or other midfacial fractures. If there is any history of loss of consciousness, brain imaging is recommended.",

Globe dystopia at initial presentation is indicative of a large fracture. It is also reasonable to wait several months to see if enophthalmos develops before offering repair. There is no clear evidence that early repair is more effective in preventing or reversing globe malposition compared to delayed repair. However, many surgeons prefer early repair simply because dissection planes and abnormal (fractured) bony anatomy are more easily discernable before posttraumatic fibrosis sets in. It may be prudent to avoid early surgery for prevention of possible globe malposition in older patients, patients with significant medical comorbidities, or patients on anticoagulation therapy for significant cardiovascular conditions.; Complex trauma involving the orbital rim or displacement of the lateral wall and/or the zygomatic arch.

Because of the eyelid edema and acidotic local environment, local anesthesia may not be effective. A field block may be used. The patient should be warned that the procedure may be painful, but fortunately in most cases, canthotomy and cantholysis can be performed quickly.; Consider placing a hemostat horizontally at the lateral canthus and clamp for 1 minute to compress the tissue and reduce bleeding (an optional step that should not be performed without good local anesthesia).; Only two instruments are needed for canthotomy and cantholysis: A pair of blunt-tipped scissors (e.g., Westcott or Stevens) and forceps with heavy teeth (e.g., Bishop Harmon or Adson). Avoid sharp-tipped scissors to minimize the chance of globe injury. Delicate forceps (e.g., 0.12-mm Castroviejo) will not provide enough traction to effectively disinsert the eyelid and should not be used.; Perform the canthotomy. Place the scissors across the lateral canthus and incise the canthus for about 1-cm full thickness (from conjunctiva to skin). Forceps are not needed for this step. This step simply gains access to the inferior crux of the lateral canthal tendon. It provides little soft tissue decompression.; Perform inferior cantholysis. With the toothed forceps, grasp the lower eyelid at the inner edge of the incised canthus. With the patient supine, traction should be directed upward, toward the ceiling. Place the scissors in an open position just beneath the skin, with the tips pointing toward the tip of the nose, and begin to cut. Some advocate “strumming” of the lateral canthal tendon, but this is not essential and sometimes difficult to assess because of tissue edema. As the canthal tendon is released, the eyelid should come completely away from the globe.\n\n NOTE: The cantholysis is critical to decompress the orbit and is done exclusively by feel. Do not visually search for a specific tendon or anatomic landmark.; There are several clues to a successful cantholysis. The eyelid should release completely away from the globe. Once the forceps are released, the lateral portion of the eyelid margin should move medially, usually to the lateral aspect of the limbus of the globe. If any eyelid margin still remains in its normal position lateral to the temporal limbus, the cantholysis is incomplete: keep cutting!; The incision will bleed; however, cautery is usually unnecessary. Pressure over the bone of the lateral orbital rim (but not on the globe and orbit) for several minutes usually results in good control. However, with the widespread use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel) as well as increasing prescription of irreversible anticoagulants (e.g., rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.), excessive bleeding can be encountered. In these cases, manual pressure is often inadequate and applying hemostatic aids (e.g., biologic agents such as thrombin and fibrinogen or physical agents such as gelatin, collagen, cellulose) may be necessary. Cautery is effective if available.; The results of a successful cantholysis are usually evident within the first 15 minutes. IOP should decrease, and the retina should reperfuse. Cadaver studies have shown a reliable correlation between IOP and intraorbital pressure. A significant decrease in IOP after cantholysis is indicative of a successful orbital soft tissue decompression. Depending on the timing of the cantholysis in relation to the hemorrhage, vision may dramatically improve. Superior cantholysis is usually unnecessary: cadaver studies have not shown a dramatic decrease in intraorbital pressure with superior cantholysis. In addition, superior cantholysis may result in lacrimal gland incision, which can bleed profusely. By far the most common reason for persistent signs of OCS following inferior cantholysis is inadequate cantholysis. Make sure the cantholysis is performed effectively.",

It is therefore dangerous to assume that a patient with recent injury/surgery, retrobulbar hemorrhage, and normal optic nerve function is stable enough for discharge. In such cases, it is best to follow the patient for 4 to 6 hours with serial examinations in the ER or hospital. If a patient presents with no evidence of OCS 6 or more hours after the initial insult, it is reasonable to discharge the patient with specific instructions (see follow up). For patients presenting with OCS, see NOTE below.\n\n NOTE: The efficacy of inferior cantholysis for OCS is based on the assumption that at the time of the procedure, all active orbital bleeding has tamponaded; this is indeed the case in the majority of retrobulbar hemorrhages. However, if active bleeding persists, the OCS will recur as the blood fills the decompressed orbit. For this reason, it is prudent to monitor patients who present with OCS and optic neuropathy for 12 to 24 hours following cantholysis.; 4. Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) are often discontinued, if possible, to prevent rebleeding.

Mechanisms vary widely. Direct bony impingement on the optic canal may result from a skull base fracture that also involves adjacent structures, including the cavernous sinus, with resultant cranial neuropathy (see Figure 3.11.1).; Optic nerve sheath hematoma: An extremely rare and difficult to diagnose direct or indirect TON. Imaging may show perineural blood in the optic nerve sheath. Often a presumptive diagnosis requiring an abnormal fundus appearance, typically a combination of retinal venous and arterial occlusions (e.g., central retinal artery occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion). Progressive visual loss may occur as the hematoma expands. In most cases, optic nerve sheath hematoma is seen in conjunction with retinal hemorrhages and a subarachnoid intracranial bleed (Terson syndrome).; Deceleration injury: The second most common form of TON, specifically known as posterior indirect TON, but often simply referred to as TON. The skull (usually the forehead, but can be the midface) hits a static object (e.g., steering wheel, bicycle handlebars, pavement) while the soft tissue within the orbit continues to move forward. Since the optic nerve is tethered at the optic canal, shearing of the nutrient pial vessels may occur with subsequent optic nerve edema within the confined space of the optic canal. A second “shock wave” mechanism may also occur. Cadaver studies have shown that a blow to the frontal bone is transmitted to the optic canal.

If external ophthalmoplegia is present, surgical exploration for avulsed EOM may be necessary.; Deceleration injury: Effective treatment of posterior indirect TON is, at best, extremely limited. Given the results of the Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) study, high-dose corticosteroids should never be offered by ophthalmologists to patients with concomitant TBI or if the TON is older than 8 hours. In the vast majority of cases, we recommend observation alone. If corticosteroids are considered (no evidence of TBI, injury within 8-hour window, no medical comorbidities), the lack of definitive therapeutic evidence and significant side effects must be discussed with the patient and/or family and the primary care team; as a practical matter, this scenario is not frequently encountered. Dosing of methylprednisolone includes a loading dose of 30 mg/kg and then 5.4 mg/kg q6h for 48 hours. Proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) should be given concomitantly. More recently, erythropoietin (EPO) and transcorneal electrical stimulation (TES) have been studied as potential treatments for TON. To date, the evidence is limited by study design, low study power, and lack of randomization and masking. At present, neither modality should be considered standard of care for TON.; Bone impingement of the optic canal: Endoscopic optic canal and orbital apex decompression may be offered in select cases, especially if the optic neuropathy is progressive. However, this option should be approached with extreme caution because of the proximity to the cavernous sinus and carotid siphon and possible bony instability of the skull base. The procedure should only be performed by an otolaryngologist and/or neurosurgeon experienced in stereotactic endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery. The patient and/or family should also be informed that there are no definitive data that prove the efficacy of this procedure in TON and that optic canal decompression may result in additional damage to the intracanalicular optic nerve.

If facial and orbital fracture repair is indicated, it is crucial to document the preoperative visual acuity and visual fields (if possible) and to explain to the patient and family that TON is already present in order to avoid later claims of iatrogenic optic nerve injury. In comatose patients with suspected TON who require facial or orbital fracture repair, the family should be informed that only limited assessment of visual function is possible preoperatively, but significant traumatic visual compromise may have occurred.

    "text": "List: Fungal: Must be considered after any traumatic corneal injury, particularly from vegetable matter (e.g., a tree branch), which may lead to filamentous fungal keratitis. Contact lens wear is another risk factor. Infiltrates commonly have feathery borders and/or may be surrounded by satellite lesions. Candida infections more frequently occur in eyes with preexisting ocular surface disease and may mimic the clinical picture of bacterial ulcers. See 4.12, Fungal Keratitis.; Acanthamoeba: This protozoan classically causes an extremely painful keratitis and/or stromal infiltrate; is associated with perineural invasion. It usually occurs in daily-wear soft contact lens wearers who may or may not practice poor lens hygiene. History of trauma or history of swimming and/or hot tubbing while wearing contact lenses may be elicited. In the early stages, the epithelial abnormality may look more like HSV keratitis than a bacterial ulcer. In the late stages (3 to 8 weeks), the infiltrate often becomes ring shaped. See 4.13, Acanthamoeba Keratitis.; HSV: May have eyelid vesicles or corneal epithelial dendrites. A history of recurrent unilateral eye disease or known ocular herpes is common. If a staining infiltrate develops in a patient with stromal herpetic keratitis, one needs to rule out bacterial superinfection. See 4.15, Herpes Simplex Virus.; Atypical mycobacteria: Usually follows ocular injuries with vegetable matter or ocular surgery, such as cataract extraction, corneal grafts, and refractive surgery (especially LASIK). It has a more indolent course. Culture plates (on Lowenstein–Jensen media) must be kept for 8 weeks. An acid-fast bacillus smear may be very helpful.; Sterile corneal thinning and ulcers: Minimal or no discharge, mild iritis, peripheral stromal infiltration with overlying staining and adjacent vascularization, and negative cultures. Corneal melting may be associated with various systemic diseases. See 4.22, Peripheral Corneal Thinning/Ulceration.; Staphylococcal hypersensitivity: Peripheral corneal infiltrates, sometimes with an overlying epithelial defect; usually multiple, often bilateral, with a clear space between the infiltrate and the limbus. Conjunctival injection is localized rather than diffuse, and there is less pain. There is minimal-to-no anterior chamber reaction. Often with coexisting blepharitis/meibomitis. See 4.18, Staphylococcal Hypersensitivity.; Sterile corneal infiltrates: Typically from an immune reaction to contact lens solutions or hypoxia related to contact lens wear. Usually multiple small, often peripheral, subepithelial infiltrates with little overlying staining and minimal anterior chamber reaction. Usually a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out an infectious process. Similar lesions can occur after adenoviral conjunctivitis, but these tend to be more central and less dense with a preceding history of conjunctivitis. See 5.1, Acute Conjunctivitis.; Residual corneal foreign body or rust ring: History of foreign body injury. May be accompanied by corneal stromal inflammation, edema, and sometimes, a sterile infiltrate. There may be a mild anterior chamber reaction. The infiltrate and inflammation usually clear after the foreign body and rust ring are removed, but a superinfection may occur.; Topical anesthetic abuse: A type of neurotrophic ulcer that should be suspected when there is poor response to appropriate therapy. In the late stages of anesthetic abuse, the corneal appearance may mimic an infectious process such as Acanthamoeba or herpes simplex stromal keratitis. A large ring opacity, edema, and anterior chamber reaction are characteristic. Crack cocaine keratopathy has a similar appearance. Healing, with or without scarring, typically occurs after the exposure to anesthetic is stopped.",

Ciprofloxacin is preferred for Pseudomonas and Serratia.; Systemic antibiotics are also necessary for Neisseria infections (e.g., ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously [i.v.] q12–24h if corneal involvement, or a single 1 g intramuscular [i.m.] dose if there is only conjunctival involvement) and for Haemophilus infections (e.g., oral amoxicillin/clavulanate [20 to 40 mg/kg/d in three divided doses]) because of occasional extraocular involvement such as otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis.\n\n NOTE: Systemic fluoroquinolones were historically used for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but are no longer recommended to treat gonococcal infections (especially in men who have sex with men, in areas of high endemic resistance, and in patients with a recent foreign travel history) due to increased resistance. Additionally, they are contraindicated in pregnant women and children.; Admission to the hospital may be necessary if:\n\nInfection is sight threatening and/or impending perforation.\nPatient has difficulty administering the antibiotics at the prescribed frequency.\nHigh likelihood of noncompliance with drops or daily follow up.\nSuspected topical anesthetic abuse.\nIntravenous antibiotics are needed (e.g., gonococcal conjunctivitis with corneal involvement). Often employed in the presence of corneal perforation and/or scleral extension of infection.; Infection is sight threatening and/or impending perforation.; Patient has difficulty administering the antibiotics at the prescribed frequency.; High likelihood of noncompliance with drops or daily follow up.; Suspected topical anesthetic abuse.; Intravenous antibiotics are needed (e.g., gonococcal conjunctivitis with corneal involvement). Often employed in the presence of corneal perforation and/or scleral extension of infection.; For atypical mycobacteria, consider prolonged treatment (q1h for 1 week, then gradually tapering) with one or more of the following topical agents: fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin), fortified amikacin (15 mg/mL), clarithromycin (1% to 4%), or fortified tobramycin (15 mg/mL). Consider oral treatment with clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. Previous LASIK has been implicated as a risk factor for atypical mycobacteria infections.",

    "text": "List: Infectious corneal infiltrate/ulcer (bacterial, fungal, Acanthamoeba): White corneal lesion that may stain with fluorescein. Must always be ruled out in contact lens patients with eye pain. See 4.11, Bacterial Keratitis, 4.12, Fungal Keratitis, and 4.13, Acanthamoeba Keratitis.; Giant papillary conjunctivitis: Itching, mucous discharge, and lens intolerance in a patient with large superior tarsal conjunctival papillae. See 4.21, Contact Lens–Induced Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis.; Hypersensitivity/toxicity reactions to preservatives in solutions: Conjunctival injection and ocular irritation typically develop shortly after lens cleaning and insertion, but can be present chronically. A recent change from one type or brand of solution is common. It not only occurs more often in patients using older preserved solutions (e.g., thimerosal or chlorhexidine as a component) but also is seen with newer “all-purpose” solutions. May be due to inadequate rinsing of lenses after enzyme use. Signs include SPK, conjunctival injection, bulbar conjunctival follicles, subepithelial or stromal corneal infiltrates, superior epithelial irregularities, and superficial scarring.; Contact lens deposits: Multiple small deposits on the contact lens, leading to corneal and conjunctival irritation. The contact lens is often old and may not have been cleaned or enzyme-treated properly in the past.; Tight lens syndrome: Symptoms may be severe and often develop within 1 or 2 days of contact lens fitting (usually a soft lens), especially if patient sleeps overnight with daily-wear lenses. No lens movement with blinking and lens appears “sucked-on” to the cornea (this can occur after rewearing a soft lens that has dried out and then been rehydrated). An imprint in the conjunctiva is often observed after the lens is removed. Central corneal edema, SPK, anterior chamber reaction, and sometimes a sterile hypopyon may develop.; Contact lens–associated red eye (CLARE): Red eye, corneal edema, iritis with or without hypopyon, hypoxic subepithelial, or stromal infiltrates (often multiple) may be present.; Corneal warpage: Seen predominantly in long-term polymethylmethacrylate hard contact lens wearers. Initially, the vision becomes blurred with glasses (“spectacle blur”) but remains good with contact lenses. Keratometry reveals distorted mires and corneal topography shows irregular astigmatism that usually eventually resolves after lens discontinuation.; Corneal neovascularization: Patients are often asymptomatic until the visual axis is involved. Superficial corneal neovascularization for 1 mm is common and usually not a concern in aphakic contact lens wearers. With any sign of chronic hypoxia, the goal is to increase oxygen permeability, increase movement, and discontinue extended-wear lenses.; Limbal stem cell deficiency: Early signs include punctate staining in a whorl-like pattern of the epithelium near the limbus, often superiorly. If untreated, the epitheliopathy can extend to involve the entire cornea. Neovascularization and haze can develop.; Contact lens keratopathy (pseudo-SLK): Hyperemia and fluorescein staining of the superior bulbar conjunctiva, particularly at the limbus. SPK, subepithelial infiltrates, stromal haze, and irregularity may be found on the superior cornea. This may represent a hypersensitivity or toxicity reaction to preservatives in contact lens solutions (classically thimerosal, but newer preservatives as well). No corneal filaments, papillary reaction, or association with thyroid disease.; Displaced contact lens: Most commonly the lens has actually fallen out of the eye and been lost. If retained, the lens is usually found in the superior fornix and may require double eversion of the upper eyelid to remove. Fluorescein will stain a soft lens to aid in finding it.; Others: Contact lens inside out, corneal abrasion (see 3.2, Corneal Abrasion), poor lens fit, damaged contact lens, and change in refractive error.",

    "text": "List: Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK), idiopathic or related to systemic connective tissue disease: Rheumatoid arthritis, GPA, relapsing polychondritis, polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus, others. Peripheral (unilateral or bilateral) corneal thinning/ulcers may be associated with sterile inflammatory infiltrates. The sclera may be involved. May progress circumferentially to involve the entire peripheral cornea. Perforation may occur. This may be the first manifestation of systemic disease (see Figure 4.22.1).; Terrien marginal degeneration: Usually bilateral, often asymptomatic. Slowly progressive thinning of the peripheral cornea; typically superior; more often in men. The anterior chamber is quiet, and the eye is typically not injected although may be associated with inflammatory signs and symptoms secondary to epithelial breakdown and inflammatory or infectious infiltrates. A yellow line (lipid) may appear, with a fine pannus along the central edge of the thinning. The thinning may slowly spread circumferentially. Refractive changes, including irregular and against-the-rule astigmatism are often present. The epithelium usually remains intact, but perforation may occur with minor trauma.; Mooren ulcer: Unilateral or bilateral. Painful corneal thinning and ulceration with inflammation. Initially starts as a focal area in the peripheral cornea, nasally or temporally with involvement of the limbus; later extends circumferentially or centrally. Unlike PUK, Mooren ulcer usually does not involve the sclera. An epithelial defect, stromal infiltrate/thinning, and an undermined leading edge are typically present. Limbal blood vessels may grow into the ulcer, and perforation can occur. Idiopathic (autoimmunity may play a key role); diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out the aforementioned systemic causes of PUK. Mooren-like ulcer has been associated with systemic hepatitis C virus infection. Bilateral cases are more resistant to treatment than unilateral cases.; Pellucid marginal degeneration: Painless, non-inflammatory bilateral asymmetric corneal thinning of the inferior peripheral cornea (usually from the 4- to 8-o’clock portions). There is no anterior chamber reaction, conjunctival injection, lipid deposition, or vascularization. The epithelium is intact. Corneal protrusion may be seen above the area of thinning. The thinning may slowly progress.; Furrow degeneration: Painless corneal thinning just peripheral to an arcus senilis, typically in the elderly. Noninflammatory without vascularization. Perforation is rare. Usually nonprogressive and does not require treatment.; Delle: Painless oval corneal thinning resulting from corneal drying and stromal dehydration adjacent to an abnormal conjunctival or corneal elevation. The overlying epithelium may be compromised but is often intact. See 4.23, Delle.; Staphylococcal hypersensitivity/marginal keratitis: Peripheral, white corneal infiltrate(s) with limbal clearing that may have an epithelial defect and mild thinning. See 4.18, Staphylococcal Hypersensitivity.; Dry eye syndrome: Peripheral (or central) sterile corneal melts may result from severe cases of dry eye. See 4.3, Dry Eye Syndrome.; Exposure/neurotrophic keratopathy: In severe cases, a sterile oval ulcer may develop in the inferior interpalpebral portion of the cornea without signs of significant inflammation. May be associated with an eyelid abnormality, a fifth or seventh cranial nerve defect, or proptosis. The ulcer may become superinfected. See 4.5, Exposure Keratopathy and 4.6, Neurotrophic Keratopathy.; Sclerokeratitis: Corneal ulceration may be associated with scleritis. Scleral edema with or without nodules develops, scleral vessels become engorged, and the sclera may develop a blue hue. An underlying connective tissue disease, especially GPA, must be ruled out. See 5.7, Scleritis.; Ocular rosacea: Typically affects the inferior cornea in middle-aged patients. Erythema and telangiectasia of the eyelid margins, corneal neovascularization. See 5.9, Ocular Rosacea.; Others: Cataract surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, previous HSV or VZV infections, and leukemia can rarely cause peripheral corneal thinning/ulceration.",

Astigmatic keratotomy (AK) is a similar procedure in which arcuate or tangential relaxing incisions are made to correct astigmatism. Now rarely used given complication rate and advancement of technology."

Patients should avoid touching their eyes, shaking hands, sharing towels or pillows, etc. Restrict work and school for patients with significant exposure to others while the eyes are red and weeping.; Frequent hand washing.; Application of preservative-free artificial tears or tear ointment four to eight times per day for 1 to 3 weeks. Advise single-use vials to limit tip contamination and spread of the condition.; Cool compresses several times per day.; Application of antihistamine drops (e.g., epinastine 0.05% b.i.d.) if itching is severe.; If a membrane/pseudomembrane is present, it should be gently peeled with a cotton-tip applicator or smooth forceps to enhance comfort, minimize corneal defects, and help prevent symblepharon formation.; If a membrane/pseudomembrane is present or if SEIs reduce vision and/or cause significant photophobia, topical steroids should be initiated. For membranes/pseudomembranes, use a more frequent steroid dose or stronger steroid (e.g., loteprednol 0.5% or prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.). Consider a steroid ointment (e.g., fluorometholone 0.1% ointment q.i.d. or dexamethasone/tobramycin 0.1%/0.3% ointment q.i.d.) in the presence of significant tearing to maintain longer medication exposure. For SEIs alone, a weaker steroid with less frequent dosing is usually sufficient (e.g., loteprednol 0.2% or 0.5% b.i.d.). Given the possible side effects, prescription of topical steroids is cautionary in the emergency room setting or in patients with questionable follow up. Steroids may hasten the resolution of the symptoms but prolong the infectious period. Additionally, steroids often necessitate a long-term taper, and delayed SEIs can recur during or after such a taper. Steroids should not be prescribed if the patient has not been examined by an eye care professional using a slit lamp.",

    "text": "List: Myogenic: While this term is often used to describe aponeurotic ptosis, true myogenic ptosis is nearly always congenital. It is present at birth and is caused by localized dysgenesis of the levator palpebrae superioris. It results in poor levator function (0 to 5 mm) and poor or absent eyelid crease. A poor Bell phenomenon (palpebral oculogyric reflex), lagophthalmos in downgaze, and upgaze limitation may indicate a double elevator palsy. Acquired myogenic ptosis is uncommon and may be seen with muscular dystrophy and CPEO.; Aponeurotic: Common cause of ptosis. Occurs secondary to levator dehiscence and is characterized by a high or absent eyelid crease, moderate degree of ptosis, and preserved levator function (10 to 15 mm). Often gets worse in downgaze. Levator stretching or dehiscence can result from normal aging, repetitive eye rubbing, use of rigid contact lenses (pulling on the eyelids to put in or take out), trauma, or previous intraocular surgery (speculum-related muscle damage).; Neurogenic: Third CN palsy (often complete ptosis, never an isolated abnormality; congenital, compressive, or vasculopathic, see 10.5, Isolated Third Cranial Nerve Palsy); Horner syndrome (mild, ∼2 mm upper and lower eyelid ptosis, see 10.2, Horner Syndrome); myasthenia gravis (variable degree, duration, and laterality, worsens with fatigue, see 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis); Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome (ptotic eyelid elevates with jaw movement); ophthalmoplegic migraine; and multiple sclerosis.; Mechanical: Foreign-body or retained contact lens in upper fornix; upper eyelid or forniceal inflammation (chalazion, giant papillary conjunctivitis, posttraumatic or postsurgical edema); and neoplasm.; Traumatic: Eyelid laceration with levator involvement, levator contusion, tethering or ischemia within an orbital roof fracture, late dehiscence, or cicatricial changes.; Pseudoptosis: Contralateral eyelid retraction or proptosis, ipsilateral enophthalmos or hypertropia, microphthalmia, phthisis bulbi, dermatochalasis, brow ptosis, eyelid tumor, edema, blepharospasm, or Duane syndrome.",

History of autoimmune disease?; Mandatory documentation: Must carefully check and document pupillary size and extraocular motility, even if normal. If anisocoria is present, measurements should be documented under light and dark conditions. Additional pharmacologic testing may be indicated (see 10.1, Anisocoria). If extraocular muscle dysfunction is noted, additional testing with prism bars may be indicated.; Complete orbital examination: Measure and compare globe position with Hertel exophthalmometry, margin reflex distance, levator function (full upper eyelid excursion with frontalis muscle held inactive at the brow), and upper eyelid crease position of both eyes. Is there lagophthalmos? Associated lower eyelid “ptosis” (elevation of ipsilateral lower eyelid retractors) is often seen in Horner syndrome. Proptosis or eyelid lag may masquerade as contralateral ptosis. Signs of aberrant eyelid movements like jaw-winking, variability and/or fatigue, orbicularis weakness, and eyelid retraction with adduction and/or infraduction? Resistance to retropulsion? Palpate superior orbit to rule out a mass or superior orbital rim deformity.; Complete ocular examination: Flip upper eyelid to examine conjunctival surface and superior fornix.

As with orbital cellulitis, preseptal cellulitis will improve with proper antibiotic treatment of bacteria and surgical treatment of any nidus. In some cases, the inflammatory cascade caused by the infection is significant and may be slow to resolve. This may improve more quickly with a short course of steroids during or after antibiotic treatment for the infection. Steroid dosing and timing of initiation vary among clinicians. Physicians may start steroids simultaneously with antibiotics, after 24 to 48 hours of antibiotic coverage, or not at all.",

See 6.2, Chalazion/Hordeolum.; Cysts: Well-circumscribed white, yellow, or clear/skin-colored lesions on the eyelid margin or underneath the skin. Epidermal inclusion cysts, sebaceous cysts, and eccrine or apocrine hidrocystomas may be excised.; Molluscum contagiosum: A viral infection of the epidermis, typically seen in children. Multiple small papules characterized by central umbilication. Can be severe in HIV-positive patients. May produce a chronic follicular conjunctivitis. Treatment is by unroofing and curettage. While some recommend curettage until bleeding occurs, there is no clear evidence that this is more effective. A variety of other therapies (e.g., cryotherapy, cautery, chemical peel, and laser) are used for lesions found elsewhere on the body but are typically not necessary for periocular regions and may cause injury to the ocular surface. See 5.2, Chronic Conjunctivitis.; Nevus: Benign melanocytic neoplasm, which may involve the dermis, the dermis–epidermis junction, or both. Congenital nevi may be present at, or shortly after, birth; however, most nevi appear during childhood and may enlarge during puberty. Nevi are well-circumscribed lesions, usually round or oval, with uniform pigmentation. Melanomas may develop within preexisting nevi and may manifest as a changing pigmented lesion and/or as a pigmented lesion with asymmetry of shape, irregular borders, color variegation, and possibly pruritus or bleeding. Suspicious lesions should be biopsied, preferably with the removal of the entire lesion to the subcutaneous fat.; Xanthelasma: Multiple, often bilateral, soft yellow plaques of lipid-laden macrophages in the medial upper and sometimes lower eyelids. Patients 40 years and younger should have a serum cholesterol and lipid profile evaluation to rule out hypercholesterolemia. Surgical excision can be performed for cosmesis; however, recurrence is possible.; Squamous papilloma: Soft, skin-colored lesions that may be smooth, rounded, or pedunculated. May enlarge or multiply over time. Often spontaneously regress. Occasionally squamous carcinomas can appear papillomatous. Therefore, excisional biopsy should be performed for suspicious lesions.; Actinic keratosis: Round, erythematous, premalignant lesion with a scaly surface. Found in sun-exposed areas of skin. Treated by excisional biopsy.; Inflammatory conditions: Blepharitis and blepharoconjunctivitis.; Allergic conditions: Chronic contact dermatitis can appear unilateral, cause cilia loss, and simulate malignancy.; Others: Verrucae from human papillomavirus, benign tumors of hair follicles, or sweat glands (e.g., syringoma), inverted follicular keratosis, neurofibroma, neurilemmoma, capillary hemangioma, cavernous hemangioma, and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma nodules of multiple myeloma appear as yellow plaques or nodules that are often mistaken for xanthelasma.",

Rarely metastasizes, but may be locally invasive, particularly when present in the medial canthal region. There are two major forms:\nNodular: Indurated, firm mass, commonly with telangiectasias over tumor margins. Sometimes the lesion center is ulcerated (see Figure 6.11.1). On rare occasions, a cystic variant is seen.\nInfiltrative: The classic variant of this form is the morpheaform lesion. A firm, flat, subcutaneous lesion with indistinct borders. More difficult to excise and may result in a large eyelid defect.; Nodular: Indurated, firm mass, commonly with telangiectasias over tumor margins. Sometimes the lesion center is ulcerated (see Figure 6.11.1). On rare occasions, a cystic variant is seen.; Infiltrative: The classic variant of this form is the morpheaform lesion. A firm, flat, subcutaneous lesion with indistinct borders. More difficult to excise and may result in a large eyelid defect.; Squamous cell carcinoma: Variable presentation, often appearing similar to basal cell carcinoma. Regional metastasis may occur and can be extensive with the propensity for perineural invasion. A premalignant lesion, actinic keratosis, may appear either as a scaly, erythematous flat lesion or as a cutaneous horn.; Keratoacanthoma: This lesion was previously considered to be benign and self-limiting; however, it is now regarded as a low-grade squamous cell carcinoma. Clinically may resemble basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Typically, the lesion is elevated with rolled margins and a large central ulcer filled with keratin. Rapid growth with slow regression and even spontaneous resolution has been observed. Lesions usually involve the lower eyelid and can be destructive. Complete excision is recommended.; Sebaceous carcinoma: More common in middle-aged or elderly patients, usually elderly women. Most common on the upper eyelid but may be multifocal, involving both the upper and the lower eyelids. Often confused with recurrent chalazia or intractable blepharitis. Loss of eyelashes and destruction of the meibomian gland orifices in the region of the tumor may occur. Regional and systemic metastasis or orbital extension is possible. Can occur many decades after prior radiation exposure to the eyelids (see Figure 6.11.2).; Others: Malignant melanoma, lymphoma, sweat gland carcinoma, metastasis (usually breast or lung), Merkel cell tumor, Kaposi sarcoma, and others.",

Stage 2 is performed after all biopsies are reviewed; Pagetoid spread is treated with cryotherapy whereas deep tumor requires excision. Reconstruction is then provided. Close follow up of regional nodes is indicated. Exenteration is often required when orbital invasion is present. Referral to an oncologist or internist for systemic workup and surveillance is important with attention to the lymph nodes, lungs, brain, liver, and bone.; Malignant melanoma: Treatment requires wide surgical excision.

CT in TED varies from patient to patient.

    "text": "List: Corticosteroids: During the acute inflammatory phase, prednisone 1 mg/kg p.o. daily, tapered over 4 to 6 weeks, is a reasonable temporizing measure to improve proptosis and diplopia in preparation for orbital decompression surgery. There is evidence that the use of a 12-week course of pulsed intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 250 mg i.v. weekly for 6 weeks) followed by a course of oral corticosteroids may result in better long-term control of TED with fewer systemic side effects than oral corticosteroids and is a reasonable option to offer patients in the acute phase of TED. Other experts question the long-term efficacy of this regimen. Periorbital corticosteroid injections are also used by some experts, but may be suboptimal to oral corticosteroids. Chronic systemic corticosteroids for long-term management should be avoided because of the systemic side effects. If systemic corticosteroids are used, a detailed discussion of the potential short- and long-term risks should be documented. The patient should undergo a baseline dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry bone density scan and be started on vitamin D/calcium supplements and gastric prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor. Close follow up with a primary care provider is also important for the management of blood sugar elevations and other side effects.; Orbital radiation: The use and efficacy of low-dose orbital radiation in the management of TED remain controversial. It may be used as a modality in the acute inflammatory phase of TED or as a means to limit progression and provide long-term control. Radiation therapy appears to decrease the severity and progression of restrictive strabismus in patients with active TED; efficacy in managing other aspects of TED (including optic neuropathy) has not been proved definitively, but is advocated by some experts. Radiation therapy should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, as it may worsen diabetic retinopathy, and in vasculopaths, as it may increase the risk of radiation retinopathy or optic neuropathy, although neither of these risks have been proven definitively. All patients offered radiation therapy should be informed of the potential risks. If used, radiation is best performed according to strict protocols with carefully controlled dosage and shielding under the supervision of a radiation oncologist familiar with the technique. Typically, a total dose of 20 Gy is administered in 10 to 14 fractions over 2 weeks. Treatment may transiently exacerbate inflammatory changes and an oral prednisone taper may mitigate these symptoms. Improvement is often seen within a few weeks of treatment, but may take several months to attain the maximal effect.; Selenium supplementation: Data from Europe confirm that the use of selenium supplementation (an antioxidant) reduces the severity and progression of mild-to-moderate TED. It remains unclear whether this finding is applicable in the United States, where no dietary selenium deficiency (as is present in certain European countries) exists. It is reasonable to offer this therapy to women with mild-to-moderate, active TED at a dose of 100 μg p.o. b.i.d for 6 months. Caution should be used in the use of selenium supplementation in men, especially with a family history of prostate cancer; some studies have suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer in males with high selenium levels, although this issue does not appear to have been settled conclusively.; Vitamin D supplementation: Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for TED. Vitamin D supplementation has been recommended with the hope of decreasing the risk of TED progression.; Biologics: Limited data are available on the use of biologic agents (e.g., rituximab, infliximab, adalimumab, etc.), with some studies showing efficacy and others finding none. Their use as primary therapy in lieu of more conventional modalities is, at present, off-label and controversial. Furthermore, there appears to be little consensus as to the most effective, specific biologic target in TED. Recently, the use of teprotumumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) has shown promise in the management of TED. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in TED patients in January 2020. For patients with moderate to severe TED, the drug is effective in decreasing exophthalmos and diplopia.; Visual loss from optic neuropathy: Treat immediately with prednisone 1 mg/kg/d with close monitoring. In cases of severe visual loss, admission for pulsed intravenous therapy may be indicated. Radiation therapy may be offered for mild-to-moderate optic neuropathy, with the understanding that there is typically a lag in the treatment effect. Posterior orbital decompression surgery (for mild-to-severe optic neuropathy), either medial or lateral, is essential and usually effective in rapidly reversing or stabilizing the optic neuropathy. Anterior orbital decompression is usually ineffective in treating TED optic neuropathy. Teprotumumab has also been shown to effectively manage optic neuropathy in TED based on small series of patients.",

It is prudent to cover CA-MRSA in severe cases of orbital cellulitis, in cases with a suspected skin source, in cases that have failed conventional therapy, or in areas of high CA-MRSA incidence. CA-MRSA is typically treated with tetracycline or a tetracycline derivative, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is on the rise.\n\nNasal decongestant spray as needed for up to 3 days.

See 3.10, Traumatic Retrobulbar Hemorrhage for indications and technique.\nThe use of systemic corticosteroids in the management of orbital cellulitis remains controversial. If systemic corticosteroids are considered, it is probably safest to wait 24 to 48 hours until an adequate intravenous antibiotic load has been given (three to four doses). Studies of pediatric orbital cellulitis with or without abscess found that the concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids with antibiotics shortened the length of intravenous antibiotic therapy and hospital stay.; In patients from the community with no recent history of hospitalization, nursing home stay, or institutional stay, we currently recommend ampicillin–sulbactam 3 g i.v. q6h for adults; 300 mg/kg per day in four divided doses for children, a maximum daily dose of 12 g ampicillin–sulbactam (8 g ampicillin component);; or; piperacillin–tazobactam 4.5 g i.v. q8h or 3.375 g q6h for adults; 240 mg of piperacillin component/kg/day in three divided doses for children, and a maximum daily dose of 18 g piperacillin.; In patients suspected of harboring hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA) or in those with suspected meningitis, add concurrent intravenous vancomycin at 15 to 20 mg/kg q8–12h for adults with normal renal function and 40 to 60 mg/kg/d in three or four divided doses for children, with a maximum daily dose of 2 g. For adults who are allergic to penicillin but can tolerate cephalosporins, use vancomycin as dosed above plus: Ceftriaxone 2 g i.v. daily and metronidazole 500 mg i.v. q8h (not to exceed 4 g/d).; For adults who are allergic to penicillin/cephalosporin, treat with a combination of a fluoroquinolone (for patients >17 years of age, moxifloxacin 400 mg i.v. daily or ciprofloxacin 400 mg i.v. q12h or levofloxacin 750 mg i.v. daily) and metronidazole 500 mg i.v. q8h.\n\n NOTE: Antibiotic dosages may need to be reduced in the presence of renal insufficiency or failure. Peak and trough levels of vancomycin are usually monitored, and dosages are adjusted as needed. BUN and creatinine levels are monitored closely. Also, be aware that many antibiotics (especially tetracycline derivatives) may change the efficacy of warfarin and other anticoagulants. It is prudent to obtain internal medicine consultation for the management of anticoagulants while the patient is using antibiotics.\n\n\n NOTE: The incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is increasing in the United States, especially in urban areas. It is extremely difficult to clinically distinguish CA-MRSA from more conventional microbial pathogens. CA-MRSA may progress more rapidly and present with greater clinical severity than typical bacterial pathogens, but these are subjective criteria. It is prudent to cover CA-MRSA in severe cases of orbital cellulitis, in cases with a suspected skin source, in cases that have failed conventional therapy, or in areas of high CA-MRSA incidence. CA-MRSA is typically treated with tetracycline or a tetracycline derivative, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is on the rise.; Nasal decongestant spray as needed for up to 3 days. Nasal corticosteroid spray may also be added to quicken the resolution of sinusitis.; Erythromycin or bacitracin ointment q.i.d. for corneal exposure and chemosis if needed.; If the orbit is tight, an optic neuropathy is present, or the IOP is severely elevated, immediate canthotomy/cantholysis may be needed. See 3.10, Traumatic Retrobulbar Hemorrhage for indications and technique.; The use of systemic corticosteroids in the management of orbital cellulitis remains controversial. If systemic corticosteroids are considered, it is probably safest to wait 24 to 48 hours until an adequate intravenous antibiotic load has been given (three to four doses).

All patients with SPA should be followed closely and managed by appropriate subspecialists, often with a combined approach (e.g., otorhinolaryngology). If an optic neuropathy is present or if the abscess is large, emergent drainage of the abscess is required. Adequate drainage may require orbital exploration. In children, a large SPA (>1250 mm3) with frontal sinus involvement often requires drainage. Simultaneous drainage of both the SPA and the paranasal sinuses appears to decrease the recurrence rate of SPA when compared to SPA drainage alone.; Leave an orbital drain in place for 24 to 48 hours to prevent abscess reformation.; Intracranial extension necessitates neurosurgical involvement.; Expect dramatic and rapid improvement after adequate drainage. Additional imaging, exploration, and drainage may be indicated if improvement does not occur rapidly.; Do not reimage immediately unless the patient is deteriorating postoperatively.

    "text": "List: Orbital cellulitis from adjacent ethmoiditis: Most common cause of proptosis in children. It is of paramount importance to quickly rule out this etiology. See 7.3.1, Orbital Cellulitis.; Dermoid and epidermoid cysts: Manifest clinically from birth to young adulthood and enlarge slowly. Preseptal dermoid cysts may become symptomatic in childhood and are most commonly found in the temporal upper eyelid or brow, and less often in the medial upper eyelid. The palpable, smooth mass may be mobile or fixed to the periosteum. Posterior dermoids typically become symptomatic in adulthood and may cause proptosis or globe displacement. Dermoid cyst rupture may mimic orbital cellulitis. The B-scan US, when used, reveals a cystic lesion with good transmission of echoes. Because of the cystic configuration and specific signal properties, CT and MRI are usually diagnostic. See 14.3, Magnetic Resonance Imaging.; Hemangioma of infancy (capillary hemangioma): Seen from birth to 2 years, generally show slow progressive growth over the first 6 to 9 months with slow involution thereafter. May be observed through the eyelid as a bluish mass or be accompanied by a red hemangioma of the skin (strawberry nevus, stork bite), which blanches with pressure (see Figure 7.4.1.1). Proptosis may be exacerbated by crying. It can enlarge over 6 to 12 months, but spontaneously regresses over the following several years. Not to be confused with the unrelated cavernous venous malformation (cavernous hemangioma) of the orbit, typically seen in adults.; Rhabdomyosarcoma: Average age of presentation is 8 to 10 years, but may occur from infancy to adulthood. May present with explosive proptosis, edema of the eyelids, a palpable eyelid lesion or subconjunctival mass, new-onset ptosis or strabismus, or a history of nosebleeds. Hallmarks are rapid onset and progression. Pain may occur in a minority of cases. Urgent biopsy and referral to a pediatric oncologist is warranted if suspected.; Metastatic neuroblastoma: Seen during the first few years of life (usually by the age of 5 years). Abrupt presentation with unilateral or bilateral proptosis, eyelid ecchymosis, and globe displacement. The child is usually systemically ill, and 80% to 90% of patients presenting with orbital involvement already have a known history of neuroblastoma. Note that metastatic neuroblastoma may also present as an isolated Horner syndrome in a child due to metastasis to the lung apex. Prognosis decreases with age.; Lymphangioma: Usually seen in the first 2  decades of life with a slowly progressive course but may abruptly worsen if the tumor spontaneously bleeds. Proptosis may be intermittent and exacerbated by upper respiratory tract infections. Lymphangioma may present as an atraumatic eyelid ecchymosis. Concomitant conjunctival, eyelid, or oropharyngeal lymphangiomas may be noted (a conjunctival lesion appears as a multicystic mass). MRI is often diagnostic. The B-scan US, when used, often reveals cystic spaces. See Figure 7.4.1.2.; Optic nerve glioma (juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma): Usually first seen at the age of 2 to 6 years and is slowly progressive. The presentation includes painless axial proptosis with decreased visual acuity and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve atrophy or swelling may be present. May be associated with neurofibromatosis (types I and II), in which case it may be bilateral. Prognosis decreases with chiasmal or hypothalamic involvement. See 13.13, Phakomatoses.; Plexiform neurofibroma: Seen in the first decade of life and is pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type I. Ptosis, eyelid hypertrophy, S-shaped deformity of the upper eyelid, or pulsating proptosis (from the absence of the greater sphenoid wing) may be present. Facial asymmetry and a palpable anterior orbital mass may also be evident. See 13.13, Phakomatoses.; Leukemia (granulocytic sarcoma): Seen in the first decade of life with rapidly evolving unilateral or bilateral proptosis and, occasionally, swelling of the temporal fossa area due to a mass. Typically, granulocytic sarcoma precedes blood or bone marrow signs of leukemia (usually acute myelogenous leukemia) by several months. Any patient with a biopsy-proven granulocytic sarcoma of the orbit must be closely followed by an oncologist for leukemia development. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia can also produce unilateral or bilateral proptosis.; Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): May present in the orbit as a rapidly progressive mass with bony erosion on imaging. Three variants are encountered in the orbit: (1) multifocal, multisystem LCH (Letterer–Siwe disease) occurs in children <2 years old with an aggressive multisystem course and poor prognosis; (2) multifocal unisystem LCH (Hand–Schüller–Christian disease) occurs in children 2 to 10 years of age. The classic triad includes exophthalmos, lytic bone lesions, and diabetes insipidus from pituitary stalk infiltration; (3) unifocal LCH (eosinophilic granuloma) typically causes bony erosion in the superolateral orbit suggestive of malignancy. Occurs in older children and adults. Systemic progression occurs in only a minority of cases.",

All hemangiomas of infancy will eventually involute. In the presence of visual compromise (e.g., amblyopia and optic neuropathy), several treatment options exist:\nSystemic ß-blockers: While the exact mechanisms remain unclear, propranolol has become the preferred option in the treatment of refractory and rapidly proliferating infantile hemangiomas. Side effects of propranolol include hypoglycemia, hypotension, and bradycardia. Asthmatics and those with reactive airway disease are at risk for bronchospasm. Therefore, patients should be evaluated by a pediatrician pretreatment and monitored throughout the course of treatment. The initial dose of ß-blocker is typically given in conjunction with cardiopulmonary monitoring. Note that not all lesions respond to this therapy.\nOral corticosteroids: Used less frequently since the introduction of ß-blockers. The dose is 2 to 3 mg/kg, tapered over 6 weeks. IOP must be monitored, and patients should be placed on GI prophylaxis.\nA local corticosteroid injection (e.g., betamethasone 6 mg/mL and triamcinolone 40 mg/mL) is seldom used.

There is a risk of spastic diplegia with this therapy. No longer used except in rare cases because of other viable alternatives, including propranolol.; Rhabdomyosarcoma: Managed by urgent biopsy and referral to a pediatric oncologist in most cases. Local radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy are given once the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy and the patient has been appropriately staged. Significant orbital and ocular complications can occur even with prompt and aggressive management. Overall, the long-term prognosis for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma has greatly improved over the past 50 years due to advances in chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and exenteration is no longer the standard of care. Prognosis depends on the subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma, location of the lesion (orbital lesions have the best prognosis), and stage of the disease. Note that prognosis for orbital lesions decreases with spread to adjacent anatomy (paranasal sinuses or intracranial vault).; Lymphangioma: Most are managed by observation. Surgical debulking is performed for a significant cosmetic deformity, ocular dysfunction (e.g., strabismus and amblyopia), or compressive optic neuropathy from acute orbital hemorrhage, but may be difficult because of the infiltrative nature of the tumor. Incidence of hemorrhage into the lesion is increased after surgery. May recur after excision. Aspiration drainage of hemorrhagic cysts (“chocolate cysts”) may temporarily improve symptoms. Sclerosing therapy has become the most frequent management option for large, cystic lesions.; Optic nerve glioma: Controversial. Observation, surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy are used variably on a case-by-case basis.; Leukemia: Managed by a pediatric oncologist. Systemic chemotherapy for leukemia. Some physicians administer orbital radiation therapy alone in isolated orbital lesions (chloromas, granulocytic sarcomas) when systemic leukemia cannot be confirmed on bone marrow studies. However, patients need to be monitored closely for eventual systemic involvement.; Metastatic neuroblastoma: Managed by a pediatric oncologist in most cases. Local radiation and systemic chemotherapy.; Plexiform neurofibroma: Surgical excision is reserved for patients with significant symptoms or disfigurement. The lesions tend to be vascular, infiltrative, and recurrent.; LCH: Therapy depends on the extent of the disease. Multisystem involvement requires chemotherapy. With unifocal involvement (eosinophilic granuloma in adults), debulking and curettage are usually curative.",

About 50% are well circumscribed on imaging, and 50% are infiltrative.

The remainder are aggressive lesions (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, among others). May occur at any adult age; orbital NHL is rare in children. Slow onset and progression unless there is an aggressive subtype. Pain may occur in up to 25% of orbital NHL. Typically develops superiorly in the anterior aspect of the orbit, with about 50% occurring in the lacrimal gland. May be accompanied by a subconjunctival salmon-colored lesion. Most orbital NHL (especially if indolent subtype) occurs without evidence of systemic lymphoma (Stage IE). Orbital NHL may be confused with IOIS, especially when it presents more acutely with pain. Note that NHL frequently responds dramatically to systemic corticosteroids, as does IOIS.\nMetastases: Usually occurs in middle-aged to elderly people with a variable onset of orbital signs. Common primary sources include the breast (most common in women), lung (most common in men), and genitourinary tract (especially prostate). Twenty percent of orbital breast cancer metastases are bilateral and frequently involve extraocular muscles. Enophthalmos (not proptosis) may be seen with scirrhous breast carcinoma. Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma has a propensity for bone and often involves the zygoma or greater sphenoid wing. Note that uveal metastases are far more common than orbital lesions by a 10 to 1 ratio.\nOthers: Mesenchymal tumors and other malignancies.; Lymphoproliferative disease (lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoma): More commonly extraconal.

    "text": "List: Metastatic disease: Systemic chemotherapy as required for the primary malignancy. Radiation therapy is often used for palliation of the orbital mass; high-dose radiation therapy may result in ocular and optic nerve damage. Hormonal therapy may be indicated in certain cases (e.g., breast and prostate adenocarcinoma).; Well-circumscribed lesions: Complete surgical excision is performed when there is compromised visual function, diplopia, rapid growth, or high suspicion of malignancy. Excision for cosmesis can be offered if the patient is willing to accept the surgical risks. An asymptomatic patient can be followed every 6 to 12 months with serial examinations and imaging. Progression of symptoms and rapidly increasing size on serial imaging are indications for exploration and biopsy/excision.; Mucocele: Systemic antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin/sulbactam 3 g i.v. q6h) followed by surgical drainage of the mucocele, usually by transnasal endoscopic technique. Orbitotomy for excision is usually unnecessary and contraindicated in most cases as disruption of the mucocele’s mucosal lining may lead to recurrent, loculated lesions.; Lymphoid tumors: Lymphoid hyperplasia and indolent lymphoma without systemic involvement are treated almost identically. With few exceptions, orbital lymphoproliferations respond dramatically to relatively low doses of radiation (∼24 Gy); ocular and optic nerve complications are therefore less common than with other malignancies. Systemic lymphoma or localized aggressive lymphoma are treated with chemotherapy and in many cases with biologics (e.g., rituximab). The vast majority of orbital lymphoma is of B-cell origin and 50% to 60% are EMZL. In older individuals with few symptoms and indolent lesions, more conservative measures may be indicated, including observation alone or brief courses of corticosteroids. To date, there is no clear role for the use of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of orbital lymphoproliferative disease except possibly in certain geographic locations. There is also no clear evidence that orbital EMZL is in any way related to Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric EMZL. Remember that the specific subtype of NHL (and therefore level of aggressiveness) and stage of the disease define the ultimate treatment.; ONSM: The diagnosis is usually based on slow progression and typical MRI findings. MRI with gadolinium is the preferred imaging modality. CT is occasionally helpful in demonstrating intralesional calcifications. Stereotactic radiation therapy is usually indicated when the tumor is growing and causing significant visual loss. Otherwise, the patient may be followed every 3 to 6 months with serial clinical examinations and imaging studies as needed. Recent studies have shown the significant efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy in decreasing tumor growth and in visual preservation. Stereotactic radiotherapy is not equivalent to gamma knife therapy (“radiosurgery”). Empiric stereotactic radiotherapy (i.e., without confirmatory biopsy) is a reasonable treatment option, but is reserved for typical cases of ONSM. Atypical or rapidly progressive lesions still require biopsy.; Localized neurofibroma: Surgical removal is performed for symptomatic and enlarging tumors. Excision may be difficult and incomplete in infiltrating neurofibromas.; Neurilemmoma: Same as for cavernous venous malformation (see above).; Mesenchymal tumors (usually SFT): Complete excision when possible. The lesion may be fixed to the surrounding normal anatomy and abut critical structures. In such cases, debulking is reasonable, with long-term follow up and serial imaging to rule out aggressive recurrence or potential malignant transformation. SFT is notoriously difficult to prognosticate. Some lesions will behave in an indolent fashion, while others may present with aggressive recurrence, regional extraorbital extension, or systemic spread.",

CT shows an irregular mass, often with bony erosion (Figure 7.6.1B).; Malignant mixed epithelial tumor (pleomorphic adenocarcinoma): Occurs primarily in elderly patients, acutely producing pain and progressing rapidly. May develop primarily or secondarily within a long-standing benign mixed epithelial tumor (“carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma”), or incompletely resected benign mixed tumor. CT findings are similar to those for ACC.; Lacrimal gland cyst (dacryops): Usually an asymptomatic mass that may fluctuate in size. Typically occurs in a young adult or middle-aged patient.; Others (may not involve the lacrimal gland, but occur superolaterally in the area of the lacrimal gland and fossa): GPA (formerly Wegener granulomatosis), tuberculosis, leukemia, mumps, mononucleosis, syphilis (exceedingly rare), mucoepidermoid carcinoma, plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma, eosinophilic granuloma, metastasis (especially prostate adenocarcinoma), and dermoid cyst (Figure 7.6.1D) (see Tables 7.4.1.2 and 14.3.2).",

See 7.4.2, Orbital Tumors in Adults.; ACC: Consider pretreatment with intra-arterial cisplatinum, followed by wide excision. Orbital exenteration and craniectomy are used less frequently, especially in smaller lesions, since there appears to be no prognostic advantage over more localized excision followed by radiotherapy. Adjunctive radiation is recommended in all patients, possibly with systemic chemotherapy. Proton beam radiotherapy is offered by some centers, but, to date, there is no proven benefit over conventional stereotactic radiotherapy. Regardless of the treatment regimen, the prognosis is guarded and recurrence is the rule. There is no clear evidence that any specific treatment regimen improves survival.

    "text": "List: Intracranial disease. Extension of intracranial tumors, usually frontal lobe or sphenoid wing meningiomas, may present with proptosis in addition to cranial neuropathy and decreased vision. Imaging, preferably with MRI, is indicated.; Cavernous sinus arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (e.g., carotid–cavernous or dural sinus fistula): AVF is either spontaneous, indirect (usually in older patients, Barrow type B-D) or posttraumatic, direct (in younger patients, Barrow type A). A bruit is sometimes heard by the patient and may be detected if ocular auscultation is performed. Pulsating proptosis, arterialized “corkscrew” conjunctival vessels, increased IOP, retinal venous congestion, and chemosis may be present. May mimic an orbital disease, including TED and IOIS. In the early stages, often misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis, asymmetric glaucoma, etc. CT scan reveals enlarged superior ophthalmic vein(s), sometimes accompanied by enlarged extraocular muscles. An orbital color Doppler US shows reversed, arterialized flow in the superior ophthalmic vein(s). MRA or CTA may reveal AVF but a definitive diagnosis usually requires cerebral arteriography. Evidence of posterior cortical venous outflow on arteriography increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Of note, posterior cortical venous outflow is more common in patients with bilateral orbital signs, but is seen in 10% of patients with unilateral presentation. Also remember that arteriography must be performed on both cerebral hemispheres and include the internal carotid, external carotid, and basilar arteries (“six vessel angio”). The cavernous sinuses are connected by the circular sinus and, on occasion, a carotid–cavernous fistula manifests clinically in the contralateral orbit.; Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis: Orbital cellulitis signs, plus dilated and sluggish pupils as well as palsies of the third, fourth, fifth, and/or sixth cranial nerves out of proportion to the degree of orbital edema. Decreasing level of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, and fevers can occur. May be bilateral with rapid progression. See 7.3.1, Orbital Cellulitis.; Orbital vasculitis (e.g., GPA and polyarteritis nodosa): Systemic signs and symptoms of vasculitis (especially sinus, renal, pulmonary, and skin disease), fever, markedly increased ESR, and positive cANCA or pANCA. Of note, cANCA may be normal in two-third of patients with the limited sino-orbital variant of GPA.; Varix: A large, dilated vein in the orbit that produces proptosis when it fills and dilates (e.g., during a Valsalva maneuver or with the head in a dependent position). When the vein is not engorged, the proptosis disappears. CT demonstrates the dilated vein if an enhanced scan is performed during a Valsalva maneuver. Calcification may be seen in long-standing lesions.; Poorly understood processes:\nTolosa–Hunt syndrome (THS): NOT equivalent to orbital apical IOIS. Histopathologically, a granulomatous inflammation of the orbital apex and/or carotid siphon within the cavernous sinus. Presents with acute pain, cranial neuropathy, and sometimes proptosis. A diagnosis of exclusion. Difficult to diagnose with CT. MRI shows isolated, ipsilateral enlargement of the cavernous sinus. Usually sensitive to corticosteroid therapy, but pain typically responds much more quickly than external ophthalmoplegia, which may take weeks to resolve. Because confirmatory biopsy is usually not feasible, every patient with presumed THS must be followed long-term, even after rapid response to corticosteroids, to rule out other etiologies. Repeat imaging is usually indicated several months after the initial event to rule out progression. Presumed THS recurs in about one-third of patients. Remember that other significant pathologies, including sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastasis, and even aneurysm may show a temporary response to corticosteroids.\nSclerosing orbital pseudotumor: Likely not a true orbital inflammation or a subtype of IOIS. May be a form of idiopathic multifocal sclerosis. Presents with chronic pain, external ophthalmoplegia, and possibly optic neuropathy. Diagnosis requires biopsy. Histopathology shows wide swaths of monotonous fibrous tissue interspersed with mild inflammation. Treatment is difficult and may necessitate antimetabolite therapy, debulking, and in severe cases, exenteration.\nOrbital amyloid: May be primary (isolated) or secondary to systemic disease. All patients require a systemic workup, including a cardiology consult to rule out cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is made by judicious orbital biopsy (this lesion is highly vascular and hemostasis is often difficult to obtain). Treatment is highly variable.; Tolosa–Hunt syndrome (THS): NOT equivalent to orbital apical IOIS.

    "text": "List: Retinoblastoma: A malignant tumor of the retina that appears as a white, nodular mass that breaks through the internal limiting membrane into the vitreous (endophytic), as a subretinal mass lesion often underlying a serous retinal detachment (exophytic), or as a diffusely spreading lesion simulating uveitis (diffuse infiltrating). Iris neovascularization is common with large tumors. Aqueous and vitreous seeding may occur. Cataract is uncommon, and the eye is normal in size. May be bilateral, unilateral, or multifocal. Diagnosis is usually made in patients under 5 years of age, with a mean age of 18 months. A family history may be elicited in about 10%.; Toxocariasis: A nematode infection that may appear as a localized, white, elevated granuloma in the retina or as a diffuse endophthalmitis. Associated with localized inflammation of ocular structures, vitreous traction bands and related macular dragging, traction retinal detachment, and cataract. It is rarely bilateral and is usually diagnosed between 6 months and 10 years of age but may present in adults as well. Paracentesis of the anterior chamber may reveal eosinophils; serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for Toxocara organisms is positive. The patient may have a history of contact with puppies or of eating dirt. Toxocariasis may also be acquired prenatally and present as a congenital infection.; Coats disease (see Figure 8.1.2): A retinal vascular abnormality resulting in microaneurysms and macroaneurysms of the retinal vessels, usually in the inferotemporal periphery. Xanthocoria may develop secondary to an exudative, often bullous retinal detachment associated with yellow-colored, lipid-rich subretinal fluid or to extensive, yellow intraretinal and subretinal exudate. Usually develops in boys during the first decade of life; more severe cases occur in early childhood. Coats disease is rarely bilateral. No family history.; Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) (previously known as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous): A developmental ocular abnormality with failure of regression of the fetal hyaloid complex, often with a fibrovascular stalk from the optic nerve to lens and anterior segment. May only present with anterior or posterior findings. It is usually associated with a small eye. Typically there is a membrane behind the lens that places inward traction on elongated ciliary processes. A cataract is noted at birth or early in life. The membrane and lens may rotate anteriorly, shallowing the anterior chamber and resulting in secondary glaucoma. Traction retinal detachment can occur. Usually unilateral. No family history or other risk factors.; Pediatric cataract: Opacity of the lens present at birth or in first months of life; may be unilateral or bilateral. There may be a family history or an associated systemic disorder. See 8.8, Pediatric Cataract.; Retinal astrocytoma: A sessile to slightly elevated, yellow-white retinal mass that may be calcified and is often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex and rarely neurofibromatosis. May occur on the optic nerve head (giant drusen) in patients with tuberous sclerosis.; Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): Predominantly occurs in premature children. Leukocoria is usually the result of a retinal detachment. See 8.2, Retinopathy of Prematurity.; Others: Retinal detachment, retinochoroidal coloboma, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), myelinated nerve fibers, uveitis, toxoplasmosis, trauma, cytomegalovirus retinitis, endophthalmitis, retinal dysplasia, incontinentia pigmenti, Norrie disease, and medulloepithelioma.",

    "text": "List: Congenital (infantile) esotropia: Manifests by age 6 months. The angle of esodeviation is usually large (>40- to 50-prism diopters) and mostly equal at distance and near fixation. Refractive error is usually normal for age (slightly hyperopic). Amblyopia is uncommon but may be present in those who do not cross-fixate. Prohibits development of binocular vision. Family history may be present. Latent nystagmus, inferior oblique overaction, and dissociated vertical deviation may develop as late findings. Congenital esotropia can occur in up to 30% of children with neurologic and developmental disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus); however, it is not necessary to perform a neurologic workup in the absence of other findings. Cycloplegic refraction should be considered first, but treatment is often surgical relatively early on in the course of the disease.; Acquired nonaccommodative esotropia: Convergent misalignment of the eyes not corrected by hyperopic lenses that develops after 6 months of age. Typically starts as intermittent but can become constant over time. Esodeviation is comitant and usually smaller (20 to 35 prism diopters) than that seen in congenital esotropia. Patients may experience diplopia. Usually corrected with strabismus surgery once the angle of the esotropia becomes consistent. In children older than 6 years, this must be assumed to be posterior fossa pathology until proven otherwise and worked up with imaging emergently.; Accommodative esotropia: Convergent misalignment of the eyes associated with activation of the accommodative reflex. May present at 6 months to 6 years of age with the average age of onset being 2.5 years. Subtypes of accommodative esotropia:\nRefractive accommodative esotropia: These children are hyperopic in the range of +3.00 to +10.00 diopters (average, +4.75). The measured angle of esodeviation is usually moderate (20- to 30-prism diopters) and is relatively equal at distance and near fixation. Full hyperopic correction eliminates the esodeviation. The accommodative convergence–accommodation angle ratio (AC/A) is normal. Amblyopia is common at presentation.\nNonrefractive accommodative esotropia (high AC/A ratio): The measured angle of esodeviation is greater at near fixation than at distance fixation. The refractive error may range from normal for age (slight hyperopia) to high hyperopia (may be seen in conjunction with refractive-type accommodative esotropia) or even myopia. Amblyopia is common.\nPartial or decompensated accommodative esotropia: Refractive and nonrefractive accommodative esotropias that have a reduction in the esodeviation when given full hyperopic correction, but still have a residual esodeviation. When partial, the residual esodeviation is the nonaccommodative component.; Refractive accommodative esotropia: These children are hyperopic in the range of +3.00 to +10.00 diopters (average, +4.75).

This is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from divergence paralysis, which, when sudden in onset, can be associated with pontine tumors, neurologic trauma, and elevated intracranial pressure. This can be a benign condition in older patients, requiring only base out prisms in glasses. See 10.8, Isolated Sixth Cranial Nerve Palsy.",

The globe retracts and the eyelid fissure narrows on adduction. In unilateral cases, the strabismus will be incomitant and the patient will often adopt a face turn to allow them to use both eyes together. May be associated with deafness and limb or vertebral abnormalities. Classified into three types:\nType 1 (most common): Limited abduction. Primary position frequently esotropia. In unilateral cases, nearly always with face turn toward affected side.\nType 2 (least common): Limited adduction. Primary position usually exotropia. In unilateral cases, often with face turn away from affected side.\nType 3: Limited abduction and adduction. Esotropia, exotropia, or no primary position deviation. Significant globe retraction.; Type 1 (most common): Limited abduction. Primary position frequently esotropia. In unilateral cases, nearly always with face turn toward affected side.; Type 2 (least common): Limited adduction. Primary position usually exotropia. In unilateral cases, often with face turn away from affected side.; Type 3: Limited abduction and adduction. Esotropia, exotropia, or no primary position deviation. Significant globe retraction.; Brown syndrome: A motility disorder characterized by limitation of elevation in adduction. Elevation in abduction is normal. Typically, eyes are aligned in primary gaze, although a vertical diplopia with chin-up head position or face turn can be present. Usually congenital, but may be idiopathic or acquired secondary to trauma, surgery, or inflammation in the area of the trochlea. Bilateral in 10% of patients.; Monocular elevation deficiency (double elevator palsy): Congenital. Unilateral limitation of elevation in all fields of gaze secondary to restriction of the inferior rectus or paresis of the inferior oblique and/or superior rectus. There may be hypotropia of the involved eye that increases in upgaze. Ptosis or pseudoptosis may be present in primary gaze. The patient may assume a chin-up position to maintain fusion if a hypotropia in primary gaze is present.; Möbius syndrome: Rare congenital condition associated with both sixth and seventh cranial nerve palsies. Esotropia is usually present. Limitation of abduction and/or adduction. A unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy is either partial or complete. Other cranial nerve palsies as well as deformities of the limbs, chest, and tongue may occur.; Congenital fibrosis syndrome: Congenital group of disorders with restriction and fibrous replacement of the extraocular muscles. Usually involves all of the extraocular muscles with total external ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Most commonly, both eyes are directed downward, so the patient assumes a chin-up position to see. Often autosomal dominant, but other inheritance patterns may be present. Genetic testing is recommended in patients with suspected congenital fibrosis syndrome.",

May be associated with abnormal teeth (e.g., microdontia, conical teeth, hypodontia), skeletal abnormalities, and redundancy of the periumbilical skin. Growth hormone deficiency, cardiac defects, deafness, and mental retardation may be seen (see Figure 8.12.1).; Peters anomaly: Failure of the lens to form properly from the surface ectoderm and completely detach from surface epithelium during 4 to 7 weeks gestation. Central corneal opacity, usually with iris strands that extend from the collarette to a posterior corneal defect behind the scar. The lens may be clear and normally positioned, cataractous and displaced anteriorly (making the anterior chamber shallow), or adherent to the corneal defect. “Peters plus” syndrome is characterized by an associated skeletal dysplasia with short stature and is more common in bilateral cases. Other malformations may also be seen (see Figure 8.12.2).; Microspherophakia: The lens is small and spherical in configuration.

In contrast, unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is only rarely associated with this syndrome. Septo-optic dysplasia includes midline abnormalities of the brain as well as growth, thyroid, and other trophic hormone deficiencies. Growth retardation, seizures as a result of hypoglycemia, and diabetes insipidus may develop. If bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is present, obtain an MRI with attention to the hypothalamic–pituitary area. If unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia is present, imaging studies may be considered as clinically relevant.; Congenital optic atrophy: Rare. Pale, normal-sized optic disc, often associated with mental retardation or cerebral palsy. Normal electroretinogram (ERG). Autosomal recessive or sporadic.; Shaken baby syndrome: Multilayered retinal hemorrhages often associated with subdural/subarachnoid hemorrhage. See 3.21, Shaken Baby Syndrome.; Extreme refractive error: Diagnosed on cycloplegic refraction.; Congenital motor nystagmus: Patients with this condition usually have a mild visual deficit (20/60 or better). Binocular conjugate horizontal nystagmus. More than one type of nystagmus may be present, including jerk, pendular, circular, or elliptical. Patients may adopt a face turn to maximize gaze in the direction of the null point. No associated central nervous system abnormalities exist.",

    "text": "List: Who to treat?\nThe decision to treat must be individualized. Some general guidelines are suggested.Is the glaucomatous process present?\nGlaucomatous damage is likely if any of the following are present: presence of thin or notched optic nerve rim, characteristic visual field loss, retinal nerve fiber layer damage, or if DDLS score is >5 (see Figure 9.1.2). Treatment should be considered in the absence of manifest damage if IOP is higher than 30 mm Hg, and/or IOP asymmetry is more than 10 mm Hg.\nIs the glaucomatous process active?\nDetermine the rate of damage progression by careful follow up. Certain causes of optic nerve rim loss may be static (e.g., prior steroid response). Disc hemorrhages suggest active disease.\nIs the glaucomatous process likely to cause disability?\nConsider the patient’s age, overall physical and social health, as well as an estimation of his or her life expectancy.; What is the treatment goal?\nThe goal of treatment is to enhance or maintain the patient’s health by halting optic nerve damage while avoiding undue side effects of treatment. The only proven method of stopping or slowing optic nerve damage is reducing IOP. Reduction of IOP by at least 30% appears to have the best chance of preventing further optic nerve damage. An optimal goal may be to reduce the IOP at least 30% below the threshold of progression. If damage is severe, greater reduction in IOP may be necessary.; How to treat?\nThe main treatment options for glaucoma include medications, laser trabeculoplasty (LT) (selective [SLT] more commonly than argon [ALT]), and glaucoma surgery. Medications or LT are appropriate initial therapies. LT may be especially suitable in patients at risk for poor compliance, with medication side effects, and who have significant trabecular meshwork (TM) pigmentation. Surgery may be appropriate initial treatment if damage is advanced in the setting of a rapid rate of progression or difficult follow up. Options include glaucoma filtering surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy, tube shunt), minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), laser cyclophotocoagulation of the ciliary body (e.g., with diode laser or endolaser), and cyclocryotherapy. Surgery should always be considered for any patient with advanced/progressive disease or IOP uncontrolled by other methods.",

Inform patients of potential pigment changes in iris and periorbital skin, as well as hypertrichosis of eyelashes. Irreversible iris pigment changes rarely occur in blue or dark brown eyes; those at highest risk for iris hyperpigmentation have hazel, gray irides.; Beta-blockers (e.g., levobunolol or timolol 0.25% to 0.5% daily or b.i.d.) should be avoided in patients with asthma, COPD, heart block, bradyarrhythmia, unstable congestive heart failure, depression, or myasthenia gravis. In addition to bronchospasm and bradycardia, other side effects include hypotension, decreased libido, central nervous system (CNS) depression, and reduced exercise tolerance.; Selective α2-receptor agonists (brimonidine 0.1%, 0.15%, or 0.2% b.i.d. to t.i.d.) are contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (risk of hypertensive crisis) and relatively contraindicated in children under the age of 5 (risk for cardiorespiratory and CNS depression). See 8.11, Congenital/Infantile Glaucoma. Apraclonidine 0.5% or 1% is rarely used due to tachyphylaxis and high allergy rate but may be used for short-term therapy (3 months).; Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) (e.g., dorzolamide 2% or brinzolamide 1% b.i.d. to t.i.d.) should be avoided, but are not contraindicated, in patients with sulfa allergy. These medications theoretically could cause the same side effects as systemic CAIs, such as metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, paresthesias, and aplastic anemia. However, systemic symptoms from topical CAIs are extremely rare. There have been no reported cases of aplastic anemia from topical use. Corneal endothelial dysfunction may be exacerbated with topical CAIs; these medications should be used cautiously in patients with Fuchs corneal dystrophy and post keratoplasty.; Miotics (e.g., pilocarpine q.i.d.) are usually used in low strengths initially (e.g., 1% to 2%) and then built up to higher strengths (e.g., 4%). Commonly not tolerated in patients <40 years because of accommodative spasm. Miotics are usually contraindicated in patients with retinal holes and should be used cautiously in patients at risk for retinal detachment (e.g., high myopes and aphakes).\n\n NOTE: Pilocarpine is not routinely used at Wills Eye due to its adverse side effect profile including associated increased risk for uveitis and retinal detachment, possibility for miosis-induced angle closure, and symptoms such as headache.; Sympathomimetics (dipivefrin 0.1% b.i.d. or epinephrine 0.5% to 2.0% b.i.d.) rarely reduce IOP to the degree of the other drugs but have few systemic side effects (rarely, cardiac arrhythmias). They often cause red eyes and may cause CME in aphakic patients.; Systemic CAIs (e.g., methazolamide 25 to 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d., acetazolamide 125 to 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to q.i.d., or acetazolamide 500 mg sequel p.o. b.i.d.) are relatively contraindicated in patients with renal failure. Potassium levels must be monitored if the patient is taking other diuretic agents or digitalis. Side effects such as fatigue, nausea, confusion, and paresthesias are common. Rare, but severe, hematologic side effects (e.g., aplastic anemia) and Stevens–Johnson syndrome have occurred. Allergy to sulfa drugs is not an absolute contraindication to the use of systemic CAIs, but extra caution should be exercised in monitoring for an allergic reaction. Intravenous forms of systemic CAIs (e.g., acetazolamide 250 to 500 mg i.v.) may be utilized if IOP decrease is urgent or if IOP is refractory to topical therapy. Consider checking baseline creatinine in patients with suspected or confirmed renal disease.",

IOP lowering by at least 30% reduced the 5-year risk of visual field progression from 35% to 12%, thus target IOPs are at least 30% lower than the level at which progressive damage was occurring. Therapies are those for POAG. See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma, for a more in-depth discussion of these therapies. There is evidence that initial therapy with brimonidine 0.2% b.i.d. may be superior to timolol 0.5% b.i.d. in preventing visual field progression in low-tension POAG.; Ischemia to the optic nerve head may play a role in the pathogenesis of low-tension POAG. Modification of cardiovascular risk factors is appropriate in managing general health but has not proven beneficial in managing glaucoma. Refer to an internist for control of blood pressure, cholesterol, and optimal management of other comorbid conditions to maximize optic nerve perfusion. If possible, avoid use of antihypertensive drugs at bedtime and use preferentially in the morning.; Presence of disc hemorrhages is more common in low-tension glaucoma and is suggestive of progressive disease, warranting more aggressive treatment.",

An untreated fellow eye has a 40% to 80% chance of acute angle closure in 5 to 10 years. Repeated angle closure attacks with a patent PI may indicate plateau iris syndrome. See 9.13, Plateau Iris.; Patients are discharged on a regimen of maintenance dose IOP-lowering drops and oral medications (described above), as well as topical steroids if inflamed. Close monitoring with IOP measurement each day is necessary immediately after an angle closure attack. Once the IOP has been reasonably reduced, follow-up frequency is guided by overall clinical response and stability. On occasion, topical steroids in addition to IOP-lowering medications are necessary for 4 to 7 days to increase the chance of successful iridotomy.\n\n NOTE: If IOP does not decrease after two courses of maximal medical therapy, a laser (YAG) PI should be considered if there is an adequate view of the iris. If IOP still does not decrease after more than one attempt at laser PI, then a laser iridoplasty, surgical PI, or cataract surgery is needed, depending on the etiology. A guarded filtration procedure should also be considered based on the severity of glaucoma and anticipated IOP control after definitive treatment. If IOP remains elevated and the angle remains closed despite a patent iridectomy, surgical treatment of chronic angle closure is indicated.; For secondary angle closure: Treat the underlying problem. Consider argon laser gonioplasty to open the angle, particularly in plateau iris syndrome or nanophthalmos. Goniosynechiolysis can be performed for chronic angle closure of <6 months’ duration.

See Appendix 13, Anterior Chamber Paracentesis.; If retinal ischemia is thought to be responsible for the NV, then treat with PRP and/or anti-VEGF intravitreal injections. If the retina cannot be visualized, lower the IOP and treat the retina once the cornea clears. These procedures are used if the angle is open as it may be possible to reverse the angle NV and restore normal aqueous outflow.; Glaucoma filtration surgery may be performed when the NV is inactive and the IOP cannot be controlled with medical therapy. Tube-shunt procedures may be helpful to control IOP in some patients with active NV, but may be complicated by postoperative bleeding. They should not be performed unless there is useful vision to preserve. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation is an option but is more often reserved for cases with poor visual potential.; Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents (e.g., ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept) may be used to promote regression of iris NV prior to, or in conjunction with, filtering surgery or PRP. Their effect is temporary, and their use for treatment of NV is currently off-label. They are particularly useful in stage 1 and 2 neovascular glaucoma, where the angle is still open, to prevent angle closure during the interval required for PRP to take effect. Caution should be used when no view of the retina is possible. (See 11.12, Diabetic Retinopathy and 11.17, Neovascular or Exudative (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration, for a discussion on anti-VEGF agents.); In eyes without useful vision, topical steroids and cycloplegics may be adequate therapy for pain control. The pain in chronic neovascular glaucoma is not primarily a function of the IOP itself; thus, reducing IOP may not be necessary if the goal is pain control and comfort measures only.

Pertinent medical history (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, known cancer or central nervous system [CNS] mass, recent infections). If ≥55 years old, ask specifically about GCA symptoms.; Complete ocular examination: Check for pupillary involvement, the directions of motility restriction (in both eyes), ptosis, a visual field defect (visual fields by confrontation), proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, orbicularis muscle weakness, and eyelid fatigue with sustained upgaze. Look carefully for signs of aberrant regeneration. See 10.6, Aberrant Regeneration of the Third Cranial Nerve.; Neurologic examination: Carefully assess the other cranial nerves on both sides.\n\n NOTE: The ipsilateral fourth cranial nerve can be assessed by focusing on a superior conjunctival blood vessel and asking the patient to look down. The eye should intort, and the blood vessel should turn down and toward the nose even if the eye cannot be adducted.; Immediate CNS imaging to rule out mass/aneurysm is indicated for all third cranial nerve palsies whether pupil-involving or pupil-sparing. One possible exception is a patient with complete sparing of the pupil and complete involvement of the other muscles (i.e., complete ptosis and complete paresis of extraocular muscles innervated by cranial nerve three).\n\n NOTE: Most sensitive modality to identify aneurysm is contrast-enhanced CTA, though MRA is also very sensitive and can be done if CTA is contraindicated or unavailable. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is most sensitive for identifying mass lesions and inflammatory etiologies. Choice of imaging should be made in conjunction with neuroradiology. If initial imaging studies are negative but clinical suspicion remains high, catheter angiography may be indicated.; Cerebral angiography is indicated for all patients >10 years of age with pupil-involving third cranial nerve palsies and whose imaging study is not definitively negative or shows a mass consistent with an aneurysm.; CBC with differential in children.; Ice test, rest test, or edrophonium chloride test when myasthenia gravis is suspected.; For suspected ischemic disease: Check blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, and hemoglobin A1c.; Immediate erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and platelet count if GCA is suspected.

    "text": "List: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (carotid–cavernous [“high-flow”] or dural–cavernous [“low-flow”]): Proptosis, chemosis, increased IOP, and dilated and tortuous (“corkscrew”) episcleral and conjunctival blood vessels are usually present (see Figure 10.10.1). Enhanced ocular pulsation (“pulsatile proptosis”) may occur, usually discernible on slit lamp examination during applanation. A bruit may be heard in high flow fistulas by the physician, and sometimes by the patient, with auscultation around the globe or temple. Reversed, arterialized flow in the superior ophthalmic vein is detectable with orbital color Doppler US. Orbital CT or MRI may show an enlarged superior ophthalmic vein. MRA or CTA may occasionally reveal the fistula, but definitive diagnosis usually requires arteriography. High-flow fistulas have an abrupt onset, often following trauma or rupture of an intracavernous aneurysm. Low-flow fistulas have a more insidious presentation, most commonly in hypertensive women >50 years of age, and are due to dural arteriovenous malformations. The Barrow classification is used for preoperative planning and subdivides carotid–cavernous fistulas as follows:\n\nDirect fistula.\nIndirect with branches solely from internal carotid artery (rare).\nIndirect with branches solely from external carotid artery.\nIndirect with branches from both internal and external carotid arteries (most common).; Direct fistula.; Indirect with branches solely from internal carotid artery (rare).; Indirect with branches solely from external carotid artery.; Indirect with branches from both internal and external carotid arteries (most common).; Tumors within the cavernous sinus: May be primary intracranial neoplasms with local invasion of the cavernous sinus (e.g., meningioma, pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma); or metastatic tumors to the cavernous sinus, either local (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma, perineural spread of a periocular squamous cell carcinoma) or distant metastasis (e.g., breast, lung, lymphoma).\n\n NOTE: Previously resected tumors may invade the cavernous sinus years after resection.; Intracavernous aneurysm: Usually not ruptured. If aneurysm does rupture, the signs of a carotid–cavernous fistula develop.; Zygomycosis (such as mucormycosis): Must be suspected in all diabetic patients, particularly those in ketoacidosis or recent poor sugar control and any debilitated or immunocompromised individual, especially patients on chemotherapy for cancer, with multiple cranial nerve palsies, with or without proptosis. Onset is typically acute. Bloody nasal discharge may be present, and nasal examination may reveal black, crusty material. This condition may produce massive hemispheric strokes and is always life threatening.; Pituitary apoplexy: Acute onset of the critical signs listed previously; often bilateral with severe headache, decreased vision, and possibly bitemporal hemianopsia or blindness. A pre-existing pituitary adenoma may enlarge during pregnancy and predispose to apoplexy. Peripartum hemorrhage/shock can cause an infarction of the pituitary gland, leading to apoplexy of a nontumorous pituitary gland (Sheehan syndrome). An enlarged sella turcica or an intrasellar mass, usually with acute hemorrhage, is seen on CT scan or MRI of the brain. Note that this may be clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from lymphocytic hypophysitis.; Varicella zoster virus: Patients with the typical zoster rash may develop ocular motor nerve palsies as well as a mid-dilated pupil that reacts better to convergence than to light.; Cavernous sinus thrombosis: Proptosis, chemosis, and eyelid edema. Usually bilateral. Fever, nausea, vomiting, and an altered level of consciousness often develop. May result from spread of infection from the face, mouth, throat, sinus, or orbit. Less commonly noninfectious, resulting from trauma or surgery. These patients are deathly ill.; Tolosa–Hunt syndrome: Acute idiopathic inflammation of the superior orbital fissure or anterior cavernous sinus. Orbital pain often precedes restriction of eye movements. Recurrent episodes are common. This is a diagnosis of exclusion after high resolution MRI and CT scans with and without contrast of the cavernous sinus area. Lymphomas often are mis-diagnosed as Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.; Others: Sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener granulomatosis), mucocele, tuberculosis, and other infectious and inflammatory conditions.",

If present, this puts the patient at greater risk for intracranial hemorrhage. These AVMs may present with a variable double vision syndrome involving partial paresis of the third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves. These lesions do not produce proptosis or any of the other external signs of cavernous sinus vascular lesions. The eyes are white and quiet. These lesions are especially difficult to diagnose and can produce large stroke syndromes.; If cavernous sinus thrombosis is being considered, obtain two to three sets of peripheral blood cultures and also culture the presumed primary source of the infection. Lemierre’s syndrome refers to an infectious thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein that is a result of spread from an oropharyngeal infection.

The dosage must be adjusted according to the response. Patients rarely benefit from >120 mg p.o. q3h of pyridostigmine. Overdosage may produce cholinergic crisis.; If symptoms persist, consider systemic steroids. There is no uniform agreement concerning the dosage. One option is to start with prednisone 20 mg p.o. daily, increasing the dose slowly until the patient is receiving 100 mg/d. These patients may require hospitalization for several days when a high-dose regimen of steroids is employed.\n\n NOTE: Steroid use in myasthenia may precipitate respiratory crisis in the first 2 weeks of treatment. Therefore, in patients with systemic symptoms, hospitalization to begin steroids is required.; Azathioprine (2-3 mg/kg/d) may be helpful in older patients. Other medications to consider include mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Some patients with systemic myasthenia are treated with regularly scheduled IVIG or plasmapheresis.; Treat any underlying thyroid disease or infection.; Surgical removal of the thymus can be performed. This is indicated for anyone with thymoma. It may also improve symptoms in patients with generalized myasthenia without thymoma.",

Buried drusen may be present and can be identified with B-scan ultrasonography or autofluorescence; will also be visible on CT imaging.; Papillitis: An afferent pupillary defect and decreased color vision are present; decreased visual acuity occurs in most cases, usually unilateral. See 10.14, Optic Neuritis.; Hypertensive optic neuropathy: Extremely high blood pressure, narrowed arterioles, arteriovenous crossing changes, hemorrhages with or without cotton–wool spots extending into the peripheral retina. See 11.10, Hypertensive Retinopathy.; Central retinal vein occlusion: Hemorrhages extend far beyond the peripapillary area; dilated and tortuous veins, generally unilateral; acute loss of vision in most cases. See 11.8, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.; Ischemic optic neuropathy: Disc swelling is pale but may be hyperemic; initially unilateral unless due to GCA, with sudden visual loss. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis) and 10.18, Nonarteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.; Infiltration of the optic disc (e.g., sarcoid or tuberculous granuloma, leukemia, metastasis, other inflammatory disease or tumor): Other ocular or systemic abnormalities may be present. Usually unilateral.; Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: Usually occurs in males in the second or third decade of life. Patients may have a family history and present with rapid visual loss of one and then the other eye within days to months. Early examination of the disc may reveal peripapillary telangiectasias followed by optic atrophy.; Orbital optic nerve tumors: Unilateral disc swelling, may have proptosis.; Diabetic papillopathy: Benign disc edema in one or both eyes of a diabetic patient, most commonly with mild visual loss. No correlation with diabetic retinopathy. In addition to disc edema, disc hyperemia due to telangiectasias of the disc vessels may occur, simulating neovascularization. More common in patients with juvenile-onset diabetes. No treatment is indicated. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs after 3 to 4 months but may take even longer.; Thyroid-related optic neuropathy: May have eyelid lag or retraction, ocular misalignment, resistance to retropulsion. See 7.2.1, Thyroid Eye Disease.; Uveitis (e.g., syphilis or sarcoidosis): Pain or photophobia, anterior chamber/vitreous cells. See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis.; Amiodarone toxicity: May present with subacute visual loss and disc edema.",

Typically pendular when chiasmal region involved and jerk if involving the midbrain. One proposal suggests a unilateral lesion of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal or its connections are responsible for this nystagmus subtype. May have a bitemporal hemianopsia resulting from chiasmal compression. May be congenital or associated with septo-optic dysplasia.; Convergence retraction: Not a true nystagmus, but convergence movements accompanied by globe retraction when the patient attempts an upward saccade. May be associated with limitation of upward gaze, eyelid retraction, and bilateral mid-dilated pupils that react poorly to light but constrict better with convergence. Usually, a pineal region tumor or other dorsal midbrain abnormality is responsible. See 10.4, Adie (Tonic) Pupil.; Downbeat: The fast phase of nystagmus is down and most prominent looking down and to the right and left. Most commonly, either a manifestation of cerebellar degeneration or associated with a lesion at the cervicomedullary junction (e.g., Arnold–Chiari malformation).; Periodic alternating: In primary position, fast eye movements are in one direction for 60 to 90 seconds and then reverse direction for 60 to 90 seconds. The cycle repeats continuously. Patients may attempt to minimize nystagmus with periodic head turning. May be congenital. Acquired forms are most commonly the result of lesions of the cervicomedullary junction and posterior fossa. Other causes include MS, medication side effects, and rarely blindness.; Gaze evoked: Absent in primary gaze, but appears as the eyes look to the side. Nystagmus increases when looking in the direction of fast phase. Slow frequency. Most commonly the result of alcohol intoxication, sedatives, and cerebellar or brainstem disease.; Peripheral vestibular: Horizontal or horizontal-rotary nystagmus. May be accompanied by vertigo, tinnitus, or deafness. May be due to dysfunction of vestibular end organ (inner ear disease), eighth cranial nerve, or eighth cranial nerve nucleus in brainstem. Destructive lesions produce fast phases opposite to lesion. Irritative lesions (e.g., Meniere disease) produce fast phase in the same direction as the lesion. Vestibular nystagmus associated with interstitial keratitis is called Cogan syndrome.; Spasmus nutans: See above.; Others: Rebound nystagmus (cerebellar lesions), Bruns nystagmus (CPA), oculomasticatory myorhythmia (Whipple disease), oculopalatal myoclonus (prior brainstem stroke).",

Ask the patient to hold eyes still and slowly tilt a large mirror from side to side in front of the eyes, holding it beyond the patient’s range of hand motion vision.

Ask the patient to look straight ahead and slowly move an optokinetic tape in front of the eyes (or rotate an optokinetic drum). If nystagmus can be elicited, vision is better than counting fingers. Note: Some patients can purposely minimize or suppress an ocular response by diverting focus past the drum.; Base-out prism test (U): Place a 4 to 6 diopter prism base-out in front of the supposedly poorly seeing eye.

Put the patient in the phoropter with both eyes open. Tell the patient to use both eyes to read each line, starting at the 20/15 line and working up the chart slowly, as described previously. Record visual acuity with both eyes open (this should be visual acuity of supposedly poorly seeing eye) and document the vision of the “good eye” through the +4.00 lens to prove the vision obtained was from the “bad eye.”; Retest visual acuity in the supposedly poorly seeing eye at 10 feet from the chart (U or B): Vision should be twice as good (e.g., a patient with 20/100 vision at 20 feet should read 20/50 at 10 feet).

Most cases of moderate to severe acute uveitis require q1–2h dosing initially. Difluprednate 0.05% may allow less frequent dosing than prednisolone acetate. Consider a loading dose (prednisolone acetate 1% one drop every minute for 5 minutes at bedtime and awakening) or fluorometholone 0.1% ophthalmic ointment at night. If the anterior uveitis is severe, unilateral, and is not responding to topical steroids, then consider periocular repository steroids (e.g., 0.5 to 1.0 mL subtenon injection of triamcinolone 40 mg/mL). See Appendix 10, Technique for Retrobulbar/Subtenon/Subconjunctival Injections.\n\n NOTE: The periocular use of triamcinolone is off-label and must be discussed with patients. A trial of topical steroids at full strength for several weeks may help identify patients at risk of a significant IOP increase from steroids. Additionally, periocular depot steroids should be used with extreme caution in patients with scleritis because of possible scleral melting.; If there is no improvement on maximal topical and repository steroids, or if the uveitis is bilateral and severe, consider systemic steroids, or immunosuppressive therapy. Consider referral to a uveitis specialist and rheumatologist.\n\n NOTE: Prior to giving periocular depot steroids, it is important to rule out infectious causes; oral steroids in such cases may be helpful starting 1 to 2 days after initiation of treatment for the underlying infection.; Treat secondary glaucoma with aqueous suppressants.

Systemic steroid therapy in children may cause growth suppression and should be avoided if possible. Prolonged cycloplegic therapy may be required and necessitate appropriate refractive correction. Consultation with rheumatology, pediatrics, and/or a uveitis specialist is useful as immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., methotrexate, adalimumab, and infliximab) is often needed. Regular follow up is essential, as flares may be asymptomatic; recurrent or chronic disease can lead to irreversible damage and various sequelae including synechiae, glaucoma (or hypotony), CME, epiretinal membrane, and cataract formation.\n\n NOTE: Cataract surgery in patients with JIA-associated uveitis has a high complication rate. Avoid cataract surgery if possible until the patient is inflammation-free for at least 3 months. An IOL may be placed in select circumstances and is preferable to aphakia in well-controlled disease.\n\nChronic iridocyclitis of children: Same as JIA.\nFHIC: Usually does not respond to or require steroids (a trial of steroids may be attempted, but they should be tapered quickly if there is no response); cycloplegics are not necessary.\n\n NOTE: Patients with FHIC usually do well with cataract surgery; however, they may develop a hyphema.\n\nSarcoidosis: See 12.6, Sarcoidosis.\nSyphilis: See 12.12, Syphilis.\nTuberculosis: Refer the patient to an internist, infectious disease specialist, or public health officer for consideration of systemic treatment.

An IOL may be placed in select circumstances and is preferable to aphakia in well-controlled disease.; Chronic iridocyclitis of children: Same as JIA.; FHIC: Usually does not respond to or require steroids (a trial of steroids may be attempted, but they should be tapered quickly if there is no response); cycloplegics are not necessary.\n\n NOTE: Patients with FHIC usually do well with cataract surgery; however, they may develop a hyphema.; Sarcoidosis: See 12.6, Sarcoidosis.; Syphilis: See 12.12, Syphilis.; Tuberculosis: Refer the patient to an internist, infectious disease specialist, or public health officer for consideration of systemic treatment. Patients with ocular TB frequently have no pulmonary disease but still require systemic four-drug antituberculous therapy. Concomitant oral steroids or methotrexate may be necessary.",

Usually spontaneously improves over weeks to months without treatment. May be associated with a cerebral vasculitis (consider MRA if the patient has a headache or other neurologic symptoms), in which case, systemic steroids are indicated.; Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS): Photopsias and acute unilateral visual loss, often after a viral illness and usually in young women. May have a shimmering scotoma. Uncommonly bilateral, sequential, or recurrent. Characterized by multiple, small white lesions deep in the retina or at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium with foveal granularity and occasionally vitreous cells. Fluorescein angiography may show a classic perifoveal “wreath-like” pattern. There is often an enlarged blind spot on formal visual field testing. Vision typically returns to normal within 6 to 8 weeks without treatment.; Birdshot retinochoroidopathy: Usually middle-aged patients with multiple bilateral, oval, creamy-yellow spots deep to the retina, approximately 1 mm in diameter, scattered throughout the fundus but most prominent in inferior quadrants. A mild to moderate vitritis is present. Retinal vasculitis, CME, and optic nerve edema may be present. ICG angiography shows characteristic hypofluorescent spots but fluorescein angiography often shows only retinal vasculitis, CME, and “quenching” of dye. Positive HLA-A29 in 95% to 100% of patients. Early systemic immunosuppression is often recommended.; Multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis: Visual loss in young myopic women more often than men, typically bilateral. Multiple, small, round, and pale inflammatory lesions (similar to histoplasmosis) are located at the level of the pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. Unlike histoplasmosis, vitritis occurs in 98% of patients. The lesions can occur in the macula and midperiphery and frequently respond to oral or periocular steroids, but typically recur with tapering, so that immunosuppressive therapy is often necessary. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) occurs in about 1/3 of patients, and so patients should return for urgent evaluation if they have decreased vision or metamorphopsia.; Punctate inner choroidopathy: Blurred vision, paracentral scotoma, and/or photopsias, usually in young myopic women. Multiple, small round yellow-white spots predominantly in posterior pole with minimal intraocular inflammation. Lesions become well-demarcated atrophic scars within weeks. CNV may develop in up to 40% of patients. Systemic immunosuppression is usually indicated.; Serpiginous choroidopathy: Typically bilateral, recurrent chorioretinitis characterized by acute lesions (yellow-white subretinal patches with indistinct margins) bordering old atrophic scars. The chorioretinal changes usually extend from the optic disc outward; however, one-third may begin in the macula. Patients are typically aged 30 to 60 years. CNV may develop. Systemic immunosuppression is usually indicated. Must be distinguished from the “serpiginous” pattern of tuberculous chorioretinitis.; Toxocariasis: Typically unilateral. Usually occurs in children. The most common presentations are a macular granuloma (elevated white retinal/subretinal lesion) with poor vision, unilateral intermediate uveitis with peripheral granuloma, or endophthalmitis. A peripheral lesion may be associated with a fibrous band extending to the optic disc, sometimes resulting in macular vessel dragging. A severe vitritis and anterior uveitis may be present. A negative undiluted Toxocara titer in an immunocompetent host usually rules out this disease. See 8.1, Leukocoria.; Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome: Punched-out chorioretinal scars, peripapillary atrophy, CNV is common. Vitreous cells are absent. See 11.24, Ocular Histoplasmosis.",

Similar to chest radiography, a normal level does not rule out sarcoidosis, and elevation is not specific. HIV, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and leprosy may also present with elevated ACE. Patients with underlying lung disease (e.g., COPD) or patients on oral steroids and/or ACE inhibitors may have falsely low ACE levels. ACE levels in children are less helpful in diagnosis.; Tissue biopsy: Definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. Obtain biopsy of accessible affected lesions, including lymph nodes or edges of skin plaques or nodules. Sarcoid granulomas are not present in erythema nodosum and these lesions should not be sampled. An acid-fast stain and a methenamine–silver stain may be performed to rule out tuberculosis and fungal infection. A nondirected conjunctival biopsy in the absence of visible lesions has a low yield and is not recommended. Indurated areas of tattooed skin with concurrent uveitis may suggest tattoo-associated uveitis; skin biopsy may show noncaseating granulomas while the chest X-ray (CXR) is normal.; PPD or IGRA: Useful for differentiating tuberculosis from sarcoidosis when pulmonary findings are present. Up to 50% of sarcoidosis patients are anergic and have no response to PPD or controls.; Other: Some authors recommend serum and urine calcium levels, liver function tests, and a serum lysozyme.

Alternative therapy includes intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg t.i.d. for 5 to 14 days (requires dose adjustment for renal insufficiency) with supplemental intravitreal injections as noted above, followed by oral valacyclovir 1 g t.i.d. or acyclovir 400 to 800 mg five times per day. Either of these regimens is maintained for up to 14 weeks from the onset of infection. Involvement of the second eye typically starts within 6 weeks of initial infection. Published literature suggests that primary treatment with oral antivirals in conjunction with the above intravitreal injections has similar efficacy as intravenous therapy. Stabilization and early regression of retinitis are usually seen within 4 days. The lesions may progress during the first 48 hours of treatment. The ideal duration of oral antiviral therapy remains unproven, but since replicating virus in the anterior chamber can be found up to 2 months after the onset of disease, a minimum of 2 months of therapy is recommended, and some experts recommend lifetime therapy to reduce the risk of second-eye involvement (especially if the first eye becomes nonfunctional).; Topical cycloplegic (e.g., atropine 1% t.i.d.) and topical steroid (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q2–6h) in the presence of anterior segment inflammation.; The benefits of antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin 81 to 650 mg daily) to minimize vascular thrombosis and help prevent further retinal ischemia remain unproven.; Systemic steroids may be considered, particularly when the optic nerve is thought to be involved. Steroids are usually delayed at least 24 hours after the initiation of antiviral therapy, or when regression of retinal necrosis is evident. A typical oral corticosteroid regimen is prednisone 60 to 80 mg/d for 1 to 2 weeks followed by a taper over 2 to 6 weeks. Subtenon injection of triamcinolone (40 mg/1 mL) can be considered after adequate loading of antiviral therapy but may interfere with the clearance of virus by the eye.; See 9.7, Inflammatory Open Angle Glaucoma, for increased IOP.; Consider prophylactic barrier laser photocoagulation posterior to active retinitis to wall off or prevent subsequent RRD (efficacy unclear).; Pars plana vitrectomy, with long-acting gas or silicone oil, is the best way to repair the associated complex RRD.

Serial fundus photographs helpful for comparison.; Relapse is defined as recurrent or new retinitis, movement of opacified border, or expansion of the atrophic zone.; Relapse can occur from resistance or subtherapeutic intraocular drug levels.

Laboratory confirmation is possible for low-grade UL97 (viral phosphotransferase) or high-grade UL54 (viral DNA polymerase) mutations.; If resistance is recognized, a change in therapy from one antiviral to the other is indicated. Consider intravenous cidofovir 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 weeks and then 3 to 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Cidofovir itself may cause uveitis and renal impairment and must be given with probenecid to reduce the nephrotoxicity. Intravitreal cidofovir is contraindicated because of the high risk of uveitis and hypotony. Cross-resistance can occur since all three anti-CMV drugs are CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors.; Discontinuation of anti-CMV maintenance therapy may be considered in select patients receiving HAART who have CD4+ counts >100 cells/mm3 for greater than 6 months and completely quiescent CMV retinitis. In these patients, whose immune system can control CMV, stopping maintenance therapy may prevent drug toxicity and drug-resistant organisms.

In the presence of a functioning immune system, the CMV antigens elicit an inflammatory response that is predominantly posterior (e.g., vitritis, papillitis, CME, and ERM).

Always include views of paranasal sinuses and cavernous sinuses.; Order both direct axial and direct coronal views if older scanners are used. Newer, multidetector CT scanners provide excellent views in coronal and parasagittal planes with very short scan times and no patient repositioning. Multidetector CT has supplanted older technology in the vast majority of hospitals and imaging centers.; When evaluating traumatic optic neuropathy, request 1-mm cuts of the orbital apex and optic canal to rule out bony impingement of the optic nerve. See 3.11, Traumatic Optic Neuropathy.; When attempting to localize ocular or orbital foreign bodies, order 1-mm cuts.; Intravenous contrast may be necessary for suspected infections or inflammatory conditions. Contrast is helpful in distinguishing orbital cellulitis from abscess. However, it is not mandatory to rule out orbital inflammation or postseptal involvement. Relative contraindications for contrast include renal failure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, multiple myeloma or other proteinemias, sickle cell disease, multiple severe allergies, and asthma. Check renal function and discuss the options with the radiologist for patients in whom renal insufficiency is suspected. Shellfish allergy is not a contraindication for CT contrast.\n\n NOTE: The radiologist may recommend premedication with corticosteroids and antihistamines if contrast is required and a prior allergy is suspected. Follow the protocol recommended by your radiology department.; Obtain a pregnancy test before obtaining CT scans in females of childbearing age.; CT angiography (CTA) is helpful in diagnosing intracranial vascular pathology, including aneurysms. It is available on all multidetector CT scanners and may be more sensitive than magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in specific clinical situations. However, it requires the use of intravenous iodinated contrast. Also note that CTA requires significantly more radiation than CT. CTA should be avoided if at all possible in children; MRA is the preferred modality in the pediatric age group.; CT scans may be obtained in children with careful consideration of the risk of radiation exposure versus benefits of performing the scan. According to the ALARA paradigm, it is best to avoid CT if possible in children unless there is no reasonable substitute. Check with your radiologist about using a pediatric protocol to limit radiation exposure. Each CT scan exposes children to a cumulative radiation dose that may increase the risk of malignancy over their lifetime. Radiation exposure from CT scans in children is of particular concern when serial imaging is required. In these cases, MRI/MRA is often a better choice for children, although intravenous sedation or general anesthesia may be needed because of the significantly longer scanning time.",

    "text": "List: For the vast majority of orbital studies, a head coil is indicated to provide bilateral orbital views extending to the optic chiasm.; Intravenous gadolinium is a useful adjunct for evaluating ocular, orbital, and perineural masses. In patients who have kidney failure, sepsis, or recent major surgery, risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) may be a contraindication. NSF is a rare but devastating complication of gadolinium that occurs weeks to months after administration. NSF is characterized by a scleroderma-like fibrosis of the skin, especially over extremities and trunk, which may involve the viscera. There is no known effective therapy or prophylaxis. Evaluate renal function in patients in whom renal insufficiency is suspected and discuss options with your radiology and nephrology departments. Recently, gadolinium deposition with specific areas of the brain has been noted in patients undergoing serial imaging. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown and is under review by the Food and Drug Administration.; Contraindications to MRI include severe claustrophobia, marked obesity, some cardiac pacemakers, some cardiac valves, suspected magnetic intraocular/intraorbital foreign bodies, spinal stimulators, vagal nerve stimulators, stapes implants, and specific breast and penile implants. Titanium plates and newer aneurysm clips are MRI safe, as are gold and platinum weights placed in the eyelids. When in doubt, ask the radiologist to look up the specific device in an MRI safety catalog. Any patient with a poorly documented implanted device should NOT be scanned with MRI until the issue is clarified. On occasion, specific types of pacemakers must be turned off and reset for an MRI.",

Currently, the limit of MRA is an aneurysm larger than about 2 mm. However, the sensitivity is highly dependent on several factors: hardware, software, availability of adequate clinical history, and the experience of the neuroradiologist. Note that in one large study, the two most critical factors in missing a posterior communicating artery aneurysm (PCOM) on MRI/MRA were lack of clinical history by the referring physician and a reading by a radiologist without fellowship training in neuroradiology. Also note that most PCOM aneurysms that manifest as an oculomotor nerve paresis or palsy are at least 4 mm in diameter. Despite these potential limitations, MRA remains a safe and sensitive screening test, especially when coupled with MRI for concomitant soft tissue imaging."

PET is extremely useful in the diagnosis and surveillance of systemic pathologies, including metastases and aggressive subtypes of lymphoma.

    "text": "Standard keratometry measures the radius of corneal curvature and then converts the radius into dioptric corneal power. Computerized corneal topography is performed using various methods, including Placido disc analysis and rasterstereography. These techniques project an image onto the cornea, most commonly a series of concentric rings, and analyze the reflection to determine corneal curvature. They can provide information on anterior corneal power and regularity. Simulated keratometry readings can be generated and the results can be represented in graphical formats, such as a variety of color maps."

These techniques include scanning slit, rotating Scheimpflug photography, and anterior segment OCT-based systems. Scanning slit and rotating Scheimpflug imaging are particularly helpful in imaging posterior corneal elevation. Rotating Scheimpflug photography and anterior segment OCT can image corneal and anterior segment anatomy."

Has the ability to image normal and abnormal corneal and anterior segment structures. It may be helpful in identifying the cause of decreased vision in patients with no known cause. It is useful for refractive surgical screening and imaging the postkeratorefractive cornea. Serial imaging is critical in the evaluation of progression of corneal ectasias."
