Evaluate the globe carefully for an apparent or occult rupture, hyphema or microhyphema, traumatic iritis, and retinal or choroidal damage. A full, dilated examination may be difficult in uncooperative patients with periocular edema but is extremely important in the management of orbital fractures. If eyelid and periocular edema limit the view, special techniques may be necessary (e.g., use of Desmarres eyelid retractors or clean bent paperclips [see Figure 3.9.1], lateral cantholysis, examination under general anesthesia).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.9.2\nComputed tomography (CT) of orbital blowout fracture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.9.3\nCoronal and sagittal cuts of a white-eyed blowout fracture (WEBOF) in a patient with an entrapped inferior rectus. White arrow, entrapped orbital soft tissue; red arrows, orbital floor fracture.\n\n\n\n NOTE: It is of paramount importance to rule out intraocular and optic nerve injury as quickly as possible in ALL patients presenting with suspected orbital fracture.\n\n\n NOTE:Pediatric patients are particularly at risk for a unique type of blowout injury: the “trapdoor” fracture. Because pediatric bones lack complete calcification, they tend to “greenstick” rather than completely fracture. This results in an initial fracture, herniation of orbital soft tissue (including EOM) through the fracture site, and rapid snapping back of the malleable bone akin to a trapdoor on a spring. Because of the tight reapposition of the fracture edges, the soft tissue trapped within the fracture becomes ischemic. Children with this type of fracture often have a remarkably benign external periocular appearance but significant EOM restriction (usually vertical) on examination; this constellation of findings has been dubbed the “white-eyed blowout fracture” (WEBOF). Children may present with a vague history, allow only a limited ocular examination, and be misdiagnosed as having an intracranial injury (e.g., concussion) leading to delay in management of WEBOF. Be aware of the oculocardiac reflex (nausea or vomiting, bradycardia, syncope, dehydration) that can accompany entrapment. Even in cases where correct orbital imaging is performed, CT evidence of an orbital fracture may be minimal and routinely missed. Careful examination of coronal and parasagittal views is critical in such cases.\nIn typical (i.e., non-WEBOF) orbital fractures, forced duction testing or testing of the doll’s eye reflex may be performed if limitation of eye movement persists beyond 1 week and restriction is suspected. In the early phase, it is often difficult to distinguish soft tissue edema or contusion from soft tissue entrapment in the fracture. See Appendix 6, Forced Duction Test and Active Force Generation Test.",
      "CT of the orbit and midface (axial, coronal, and parasagittal views, 1- to 1.5-mm sections, without contrast) is obtained in all cases of suspected orbital fractures. Bone windows are especially helpful in fracture evaluation (see Figures 3.9.2 and 3.9.3), including the narrow, oft-missed WEBOF. Inclusion of the midfacial skeleton is mandatory to rule out zygomatic complex or other midfacial fractures. If there is any history of loss of consciousness, brain imaging is recommended."

Some advocate “strumming” of the lateral canthal tendon, but this is not essential and sometimes difficult to assess because of tissue edema.

In these cases, manual pressure is often inadequate and applying hemostatic aids (e.g., biologic agents such as thrombin and fibrinogen or physical agents such as gelatin, collagen, cellulose) may be necessary. Cautery is effective if available.",
      "The results of a successful cantholysis are usually evident within the first 15 minutes. IOP should decrease, and the retina should reperfuse. Cadaver studies have shown a reliable correlation between IOP and intraorbital pressure. A significant decrease in IOP after cantholysis is indicative of a successful orbital soft tissue decompression. Depending on the timing of the cantholysis in relation to the hemorrhage, vision may dramatically improve. Superior cantholysis is usually unnecessary: cadaver studies have not shown a dramatic decrease in intraorbital pressure with superior cantholysis. In addition, superior cantholysis may result in lacrimal gland incision, which can bleed profusely. By far the most common reason for persistent signs of OCS following inferior cantholysis is inadequate cantholysis. Make sure the cantholysis is performed effectively."

The skull (usually the forehead, but can be the midface) hits a static object (e.g., steering wheel, bicycle handlebars, pavement) while the soft tissue within the orbit continues to move forward. Since the optic nerve is tethered at the optic canal, shearing of the nutrient pial vessels may occur with subsequent optic nerve edema within the confined space of the optic canal. A second “shock wave” mechanism may also occur. Cadaver studies have shown that a blow to the frontal bone is transmitted to the optic canal. Visual loss from posterior indirect TON is typically immediate and progresses in fewer than 10% of cases.",

Given the results of the Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury (CRASH) study, high-dose corticosteroids should never be offered by ophthalmologists to patients with concomitant TBI or if the TON is older than 8 hours. In the vast majority of cases, we recommend observation alone. If corticosteroids are considered (no evidence of TBI, injury within 8-hour window, no medical comorbidities), the lack of definitive therapeutic evidence and significant side effects must be discussed with the patient and/or family and the primary care team; as a practical matter, this scenario is not frequently encountered. Dosing of methylprednisolone includes a loading dose of 30 mg/kg and then 5.4 mg/kg q6h for 48 hours. Proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) should be given concomitantly. More recently, erythropoietin (EPO) and transcorneal electrical stimulation (TES) have been studied as potential treatments for TON. To date, the evidence is limited by study design, low study power, and lack of randomization and masking. At present, neither modality should be considered standard of care for TON.",

However, this option should be approached with extreme caution because of the proximity to the cavernous sinus and carotid siphon and possible bony instability of the skull base. The procedure should only be performed by an otolaryngologist and/or neurosurgeon experienced in stereotactic endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery. The patient and/or family should also be informed that there are no definitive data that prove the efficacy of this procedure in TON and that optic canal decompression may result in additional damage to the intracanalicular optic nerve. On occasion, a transcranial approach for optic canal decompression is indicated, depending on the location of the bone fragments."

      "Fungal: Must be considered after any traumatic corneal injury, particularly from vegetable matter (e.g., a tree branch), which may lead to filamentous fungal keratitis. Contact lens wear is another risk factor. Infiltrates commonly have feathery borders and/or may be surrounded by satellite lesions. Candida infections more frequently occur in eyes with preexisting ocular surface disease and may mimic the clinical picture of bacterial ulcers. See 4.12, Fungal Keratitis.",

It usually occurs in daily-wear soft contact lens wearers who may or may not practice poor lens hygiene. History of trauma or history of swimming and/or hot tubbing while wearing contact lenses may be elicited. In the early stages, the epithelial abnormality may look more like HSV keratitis than a bacterial ulcer. In the late stages (3 to 8 weeks), the infiltrate often becomes ring shaped. See 4.13, Acanthamoeba Keratitis.",

Usually multiple small, often peripheral, subepithelial infiltrates with little overlying staining and minimal anterior chamber reaction. Usually a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out an infectious process. Similar lesions can occur after adenoviral conjunctivitis, but these tend to be more central and less dense with a preceding history of conjunctivitis. See 5.1, Acute Conjunctivitis.",
      "Residual corneal foreign body or rust ring: History of foreign body injury. May be accompanied by corneal stromal inflammation, edema, and sometimes, a sterile infiltrate. There may be a mild anterior chamber reaction. The infiltrate and inflammation usually clear after the foreign body and rust ring are removed, but a superinfection may occur.",
      "Topical anesthetic abuse: A type of neurotrophic ulcer that should be suspected when there is poor response to appropriate therapy. In the late stages of anesthetic abuse, the corneal appearance may mimic an infectious process such as Acanthamoeba or herpes simplex stromal keratitis. A large ring opacity, edema, and anterior chamber reaction are characteristic. Crack cocaine keratopathy has a similar appearance. Healing, with or without scarring, typically occurs after the exposure to anesthetic is stopped."

The anterior chamber is quiet, and the eye is typically not injected although may be associated with inflammatory signs and symptoms secondary to epithelial breakdown and inflammatory or infectious infiltrates. A yellow line (lipid) may appear, with a fine pannus along the central edge of the thinning. The thinning may slowly spread circumferentially. Refractive changes, including irregular and against-the-rule astigmatism are often present. The epithelium usually remains intact, but perforation may occur with minor trauma.",

Limbal blood vessels may grow into the ulcer, and perforation can occur. Idiopathic (autoimmunity may play a key role); diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out the aforementioned systemic causes of PUK. Mooren-like ulcer has been associated with systemic hepatitis C virus infection. Bilateral cases are more resistant to treatment than unilateral cases.",

For membranes/pseudomembranes, use a more frequent steroid dose or stronger steroid (e.g., loteprednol 0.5% or prednisolone acetate 1% q.i.d.). Consider a steroid ointment (e.g., fluorometholone 0.1% ointment q.i.d. or dexamethasone/tobramycin 0.1%/0.3% ointment q.i.d.) in the presence of significant tearing to maintain longer medication exposure. For SEIs alone, a weaker steroid with less frequent dosing is usually sufficient (e.g., loteprednol 0.2% or 0.5% b.i.d.). Given the possible side effects, prescription of topical steroids is cautionary in the emergency room setting or in patients with questionable follow up. Steroids may hasten the resolution of the symptoms but prolong the infectious period. Additionally, steroids often necessitate a long-term taper, and delayed SEIs can recur during or after such a taper. Steroids should not be prescribed if the patient has not been examined by an eye care professional using a slit lamp."

      "Myogenic: While this term is often used to describe aponeurotic ptosis, true myogenic ptosis is nearly always congenital. It is present at birth and is caused by localized dysgenesis of the levator palpebrae superioris. It results in poor levator function (0 to 5 mm) and poor or absent eyelid crease. A poor Bell phenomenon (palpebral oculogyric reflex), lagophthalmos in downgaze, and upgaze limitation may indicate a double elevator palsy. Acquired myogenic ptosis is uncommon and may be seen with muscular dystrophy and CPEO.",
      "Aponeurotic: Common cause of ptosis. Occurs secondary to levator dehiscence and is characterized by a high or absent eyelid crease, moderate degree of ptosis, and preserved levator function (10 to 15 mm). Often gets worse in downgaze. Levator stretching or dehiscence can result from normal aging, repetitive eye rubbing, use of rigid contact lenses (pulling on the eyelids to put in or take out), trauma, or previous intraocular surgery (speculum-related muscle damage).",
      "Neurogenic: Third CN palsy (often complete ptosis, never an isolated abnormality; congenital, compressive, or vasculopathic, see 10.5, Isolated Third Cranial Nerve Palsy); Horner syndrome (mild, ∼2 mm upper and lower eyelid ptosis, see 10.2, Horner Syndrome); myasthenia gravis (variable degree, duration, and laterality, worsens with fatigue, see 10.11, Myasthenia Gravis); Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome (ptotic eyelid elevates with jaw movement); ophthalmoplegic migraine; and multiple sclerosis.",

      "Corticosteroids: During the acute inflammatory phase, prednisone 1 mg/kg p.o. daily, tapered over 4 to 6 weeks, is a reasonable temporizing measure to improve proptosis and diplopia in preparation for orbital decompression surgery. There is evidence that the use of a 12-week course of pulsed intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 250 mg i.v. weekly for 6 weeks) followed by a course of oral corticosteroids may result in better long-term control of TED with fewer systemic side effects than oral corticosteroids and is a reasonable option to offer patients in the acute phase of TED. Other experts question the long-term efficacy of this regimen. Periorbital corticosteroid injections are also used by some experts, but may be suboptimal to oral corticosteroids. Chronic systemic corticosteroids for long-term management should be avoided because of the systemic side effects. If systemic corticosteroids are used, a detailed discussion of the potential short- and long-term risks should be documented. The patient should undergo a baseline dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry bone density scan and be started on vitamin D/calcium supplements and gastric prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor. Close follow up with a primary care provider is also important for the management of blood sugar elevations and other side effects.",
      "Orbital radiation: The use and efficacy of low-dose orbital radiation in the management of TED remain controversial. It may be used as a modality in the acute inflammatory phase of TED or as a means to limit progression and provide long-term control. Radiation therapy appears to decrease the severity and progression of restrictive strabismus in patients with active TED; efficacy in managing other aspects of TED (including optic neuropathy) has not been proved definitively, but is advocated by some experts. Radiation therapy should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, as it may worsen diabetic retinopathy, and in vasculopaths, as it may increase the risk of radiation retinopathy or optic neuropathy, although neither of these risks have been proven definitively. All patients offered radiation therapy should be informed of the potential risks. If used, radiation is best performed according to strict protocols with carefully controlled dosage and shielding under the supervision of a radiation oncologist familiar with the technique. Typically, a total dose of 20 Gy is administered in 10 to 14 fractions over 2 weeks. Treatment may transiently exacerbate inflammatory changes and an oral prednisone taper may mitigate these symptoms. Improvement is often seen within a few weeks of treatment, but may take several months to attain the maximal effect.",
      "Selenium supplementation: Data from Europe confirm that the use of selenium supplementation (an antioxidant) reduces the severity and progression of mild-to-moderate TED. It remains unclear whether this finding is applicable in the United States, where no dietary selenium deficiency (as is present in certain European countries) exists. It is reasonable to offer this therapy to women with mild-to-moderate, active TED at a dose of 100 μg p.o. b.i.d for 6 months. Caution should be used in the use of selenium supplementation in men, especially with a family history of prostate cancer; some studies have suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer in males with high selenium levels, although this issue does not appear to have been settled conclusively.",
      "Vitamin D supplementation: Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for TED. Vitamin D supplementation has been recommended with the hope of decreasing the risk of TED progression.",
      "Biologics: Limited data are available on the use of biologic agents (e.g., rituximab, infliximab, adalimumab, etc.), with some studies showing efficacy and others finding none. Their use as primary therapy in lieu of more conventional modalities is, at present, off-label and controversial. Furthermore, there appears to be little consensus as to the most effective, specific biologic target in TED. Recently, the use of teprotumumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) has shown promise in the management of TED. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in TED patients in January 2020. For patients with moderate to severe TED, the drug is effective in decreasing exophthalmos and diplopia.",
      "Visual loss from optic neuropathy: Treat immediately with prednisone 1 mg/kg/d with close monitoring. In cases of severe visual loss, admission for pulsed intravenous therapy may be indicated. Radiation therapy may be offered for mild-to-moderate optic neuropathy, with the understanding that there is typically a lag in the treatment effect. Posterior orbital decompression surgery (for mild-to-severe optic neuropathy), either medial or lateral, is essential and usually effective in rapidly reversing or stabilizing the optic neuropathy. Anterior orbital decompression is usually ineffective in treating TED optic neuropathy. Teprotumumab has also been shown to effectively manage optic neuropathy in TED based on small series of patients."

Bony erosion is very rare in IOIS and warrants further workup. Orbital MRI with contrast and fat suppression: May show EOM enlargement, infiltration of orbital fat, enlargement of the lacrimal gland, thickening of posterior Tenon/sclera, and enhancement along the optic nerve (perineuritis). In IOIS, the enhancement tends to “spill over” from an anatomic nidus into adjacent tissue (e.g., from EOM into surrounding orbital fat).",

If sarcoidosis is suspected, consider chest CT which is significantly more sensitive than chest X-ray (CXR). Mammography and prostate evaluation are warranted in specific or atypical cases. Consider QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing before instituting corticosteroids in at-risk patients.",
      "If possible, perform an incisional biopsy of involved orbital tissue if easily accessible with minimal morbidity before instituting corticosteroid therapy (corticosteroid therapy may mask the true diagnosis). The lacrimal gland is often involved in IOIS and is relatively easy to access surgically; strong consideration should be given to biopsy all cases of suspected inflammatory dacryoadenitis. However, a biopsy of other orbital structures (extraocular muscle and orbital apex) is typically avoided in cases of classic IOIS because of the potential surgical risks; biopsy of these structures is reserved for atypical or recurrent cases. Always be suspicious of metastatic disease in any patient with a history of cancer."

In bacterial cases, the patient is usually also septic and may be obtunded and hemodynamically unstable. Dental infections have a propensity for aggressive behavior and may spread along the midfacial and skull base venous plexuses into the cavernous sinus. Prognosis is guarded in all cases. Manage with hemodynamic support (possibly in an intensive care unit), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and surgical drainage if an infectious nidus is identified (e.g., paranasal sinuses, tooth abscess, and orbit). Anticoagulation can be considered to limit the propagation of the thrombosis into the central venous sinuses."

      "Microbes involved in SPA formation vary and are to a degree related to the age of the patient. The causative microbes influence response to intravenous antibiotics and the need for surgical drainage. See Table 7.3.2.1.\n\n NOTE: These are guidelines only. All patients with SPA should be followed closely and managed by appropriate subspecialists, often with a combined approach (e.g., otorhinolaryngology). If an optic neuropathy is present or if the abscess is large, emergent drainage of the abscess is required. Adequate drainage may require orbital exploration. In children, a large SPA (>1250 mm3) with frontal sinus involvement often requires drainage. Simultaneous drainage of both the SPA and the paranasal sinuses appears to decrease the recurrence rate of SPA when compared to SPA drainage alone.",

      "Dermoid and epidermoid cysts: Manifest clinically from birth to young adulthood and enlarge slowly. Preseptal dermoid cysts may become symptomatic in childhood and are most commonly found in the temporal upper eyelid or brow, and less often in the medial upper eyelid. The palpable, smooth mass may be mobile or fixed to the periosteum. Posterior dermoids typically become symptomatic in adulthood and may cause proptosis or globe displacement. Dermoid cyst rupture may mimic orbital cellulitis. The B-scan US, when used, reveals a cystic lesion with good transmission of echoes. Because of the cystic configuration and specific signal properties, CT and MRI are usually diagnostic. See 14.3, Magnetic Resonance Imaging.",
      "Hemangioma of infancy (capillary hemangioma): Seen from birth to 2 years, generally show slow progressive growth over the first 6 to 9 months with slow involution thereafter. May be observed through the eyelid as a bluish mass or be accompanied by a red hemangioma of the skin (strawberry nevus, stork bite), which blanches with pressure (see Figure 7.4.1.1). Proptosis may be exacerbated by crying. It can enlarge over 6 to 12 months, but spontaneously regresses over the following several years. Not to be confused with the unrelated cavernous venous malformation (cavernous hemangioma) of the orbit, typically seen in adults.",

May present with explosive proptosis, edema of the eyelids, a palpable eyelid lesion or subconjunctival mass, new-onset ptosis or strabismus, or a history of nosebleeds. Hallmarks are rapid onset and progression. Pain may occur in a minority of cases. Urgent biopsy and referral to a pediatric oncologist is warranted if suspected.",
      "Metastatic neuroblastoma: Seen during the first few years of life (usually by the age of 5 years). Abrupt presentation with unilateral or bilateral proptosis, eyelid ecchymosis, and globe displacement. The child is usually systemically ill, and 80% to 90% of patients presenting with orbital involvement already have a known history of neuroblastoma. Note that metastatic neuroblastoma may also present as an isolated Horner syndrome in a child due to metastasis to the lung apex. Prognosis decreases with age.",

Proptosis may be intermittent and exacerbated by upper respiratory tract infections. Lymphangioma may present as an atraumatic eyelid ecchymosis. Concomitant conjunctival, eyelid, or oropharyngeal lymphangiomas may be noted (a conjunctival lesion appears as a multicystic mass). MRI is often diagnostic. The B-scan US, when used, often reveals cystic spaces. See Figure 7.4.1.2.",
      "Optic nerve glioma (juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma): Usually first seen at the age of 2 to 6 years and is slowly progressive. The presentation includes painless axial proptosis with decreased visual acuity and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Optic nerve atrophy or swelling may be present. May be associated with neurofibromatosis (types I and II), in which case it may be bilateral. Prognosis decreases with chiasmal or hypothalamic involvement. See 13.13, Phakomatoses.",
      "Plexiform neurofibroma: Seen in the first decade of life and is pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type I. Ptosis, eyelid hypertrophy, S-shaped deformity of the upper eyelid, or pulsating proptosis (from the absence of the greater sphenoid wing) may be present. Facial asymmetry and a palpable anterior orbital mass may also be evident. See 13.13, Phakomatoses.",
      "Leukemia (granulocytic sarcoma): Seen in the first decade of life with rapidly evolving unilateral or bilateral proptosis and, occasionally, swelling of the temporal fossa area due to a mass. Typically, granulocytic sarcoma precedes blood or bone marrow signs of leukemia (usually acute myelogenous leukemia) by several months. Any patient with a biopsy-proven granulocytic sarcoma of the orbit must be closely followed by an oncologist for leukemia development. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia can also produce unilateral or bilateral proptosis.",
      "Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): May present in the orbit as a rapidly progressive mass with bony erosion on imaging. Three variants are encountered in the orbit: (1) multifocal, multisystem LCH (Letterer–Siwe disease) occurs in children <2 years old with an aggressive multisystem course and poor prognosis; (2) multifocal unisystem LCH (Hand–Schüller–Christian disease) occurs in children 2 to 10 years of age. The classic triad includes exophthalmos, lytic bone lesions, and diabetes insipidus from pituitary stalk infiltration; (3) unifocal LCH (eosinophilic granuloma) typically causes bony erosion in the superolateral orbit suggestive of malignancy. Occurs in older children and adults. Systemic progression occurs in only a minority of cases."

The vast majority of orbital lymphoma is of B-cell origin and 50% to 60% are EMZL. In older individuals with few symptoms and indolent lesions, more conservative measures may be indicated, including observation alone or brief courses of corticosteroids. To date, there is no clear role for the use of systemic antibiotics in the treatment of orbital lymphoproliferative disease except possibly in certain geographic locations. There is also no clear evidence that orbital EMZL is in any way related to Helicobacter pylori-associated gastric EMZL. Remember that the specific subtype of NHL (and therefore level of aggressiveness) and stage of the disease define the ultimate treatment.",
      "ONSM: The diagnosis is usually based on slow progression and typical MRI findings. MRI with gadolinium is the preferred imaging modality. CT is occasionally helpful in demonstrating intralesional calcifications. Stereotactic radiation therapy is usually indicated when the tumor is growing and causing significant visual loss. Otherwise, the patient may be followed every 3 to 6 months with serial clinical examinations and imaging studies as needed. Recent studies have shown the significant efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy in decreasing tumor growth and in visual preservation. Stereotactic radiotherapy is not equivalent to gamma knife therapy (“radiosurgery”). Empiric stereotactic radiotherapy (i.e., without confirmatory biopsy) is a reasonable treatment option, but is reserved for typical cases of ONSM.

      "ACC: Consider pretreatment with intra-arterial cisplatinum, followed by wide excision. Orbital exenteration and craniectomy are used less frequently, especially in smaller lesions, since there appears to be no prognostic advantage over more localized excision followed by radiotherapy. Adjunctive radiation is recommended in all patients, possibly with systemic chemotherapy. Proton beam radiotherapy is offered by some centers, but, to date, there is no proven benefit over conventional stereotactic radiotherapy. Regardless of the treatment regimen, the prognosis is guarded and recurrence is the rule. There is no clear evidence that any specific treatment regimen improves survival. Survival appears to be most dependent on the specific tumor subtype (basaloid or nonbasaloid) and possibly initial tumor size.",

A bruit is sometimes heard by the patient and may be detected if ocular auscultation is performed. Pulsating proptosis, arterialized “corkscrew” conjunctival vessels, increased IOP, retinal venous congestion, and chemosis may be present. May mimic an orbital disease, including TED and IOIS. In the early stages, often misdiagnosed as conjunctivitis, asymmetric glaucoma, etc. CT scan reveals enlarged superior ophthalmic vein(s), sometimes accompanied by enlarged extraocular muscles. An orbital color Doppler US shows reversed, arterialized flow in the superior ophthalmic vein(s). MRA or CTA may reveal AVF but a definitive diagnosis usually requires cerebral arteriography. Evidence of posterior cortical venous outflow on arteriography increases the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Of note, posterior cortical venous outflow is more common in patients with bilateral orbital signs, but is seen in 10% of patients with unilateral presentation. Also remember that arteriography must be performed on both cerebral hemispheres and include the internal carotid, external carotid, and basilar arteries (“six vessel angio”). The cavernous sinuses are connected by the circular sinus and, on occasion, a carotid–cavernous fistula manifests clinically in the contralateral orbit.",

Decreasing level of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, and fevers can occur. May be bilateral with rapid progression. See 7.3.1, Orbital Cellulitis.",

      "Varix: A large, dilated vein in the orbit that produces proptosis when it fills and dilates (e.g., during a Valsalva maneuver or with the head in a dependent position). When the vein is not engorged, the proptosis disappears. CT demonstrates the dilated vein if an enhanced scan is performed during a Valsalva maneuver. Calcification may be seen in long-standing lesions.",

Histopathologically, a granulomatous inflammation of the orbital apex and/or carotid siphon within the cavernous sinus. Presents with acute pain, cranial neuropathy, and sometimes proptosis. A diagnosis of exclusion. Difficult to diagnose with CT. MRI shows isolated, ipsilateral enlargement of the cavernous sinus. Usually sensitive to corticosteroid therapy, but pain typically responds much more quickly than external ophthalmoplegia, which may take weeks to resolve. Because confirmatory biopsy is usually not feasible, every patient with presumed THS must be followed long-term, even after rapid response to corticosteroids, to rule out other etiologies. Repeat imaging is usually indicated several months after the initial event to rule out progression. Presumed THS recurs in about one-third of patients. Remember that other significant pathologies, including sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastasis, and even aneurysm may show a temporary response to corticosteroids.\nSclerosing orbital pseudotumor: Likely not a true orbital inflammation or a subtype of IOIS. May be a form of idiopathic multifocal sclerosis. Presents with chronic pain, external ophthalmoplegia, and possibly optic neuropathy. Diagnosis requires biopsy. Histopathology shows wide swaths of monotonous fibrous tissue interspersed with mild inflammation. Treatment is difficult and may necessitate antimetabolite therapy, debulking, and in severe cases, exenteration.\nOrbital amyloid: May be primary (isolated) or secondary to systemic disease. All patients require a systemic workup, including a cardiology consult to rule out cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is made by judicious orbital biopsy (this lesion is highly vascular and hemostasis is often difficult to obtain). Treatment is highly variable.",

Iris neovascularization is common with large tumors. Aqueous and vitreous seeding may occur. Cataract is uncommon, and the eye is normal in size. May be bilateral, unilateral, or multifocal. Diagnosis is usually made in patients under 5 years of age, with a mean age of 18 months. A family history may be elicited in about 10%.",

Associated with localized inflammation of ocular structures, vitreous traction bands and related macular dragging, traction retinal detachment, and cataract. It is rarely bilateral and is usually diagnosed between 6 months and 10 years of age but may present in adults as well. Paracentesis of the anterior chamber may reveal eosinophils; serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for Toxocara organisms is positive.

Typically there is a membrane behind the lens that places inward traction on elongated ciliary processes. A cataract is noted at birth or early in life. The membrane and lens may rotate anteriorly, shallowing the anterior chamber and resulting in secondary glaucoma. Traction retinal detachment can occur. Usually unilateral.

This is likely due to dissociation and breakdown of their binocular alignment.\nClinical evaluation:\nGood control: One eye turns out at only after cover testing and the patient is able to regain fusion quickly without blinking or refixating when the cover is removed.\nFair control: One eye turns out after cover testing and the patient can only regain fusion with blinking or refixating.\nPoor control: One eye turns out spontaneously and remains manifest for an extended period of time.\n\n\nGood, fair, or poor control can be seen in all four types of intermittent exotropia:\nBasic: Exodeviation is approximately the same with distance and near fixation.\nTrue divergence excess: Exodeviation that remains greater at distance than near after a period of monocular occlusion.\nSimulated divergence excess: Exodeviation that is initially greater with distance fixation than near that becomes approximately the same after an interval of monocular occlusion.\nConvergence insufficiency: Exodeviation is greater at near than distance.

      "Who to treat?\nThe decision to treat must be individualized. Some general guidelines are suggested.Is the glaucomatous process present?\nGlaucomatous damage is likely if any of the following are present: presence of thin or notched optic nerve rim, characteristic visual field loss, retinal nerve fiber layer damage, or if DDLS score is >5 (see Figure 9.1.2). Treatment should be considered in the absence of manifest damage if IOP is higher than 30 mm Hg, and/or IOP asymmetry is more than 10 mm Hg.\nIs the glaucomatous process active?\nDetermine the rate of damage progression by careful follow up. Certain causes of optic nerve rim loss may be static (e.g., prior steroid response). Disc hemorrhages suggest active disease.\nIs the glaucomatous process likely to cause disability?\nConsider the patient’s age, overall physical and social health, as well as an estimation of his or her life expectancy.",
      "What is the treatment goal?\nThe goal of treatment is to enhance or maintain the patient’s health by halting optic nerve damage while avoiding undue side effects of treatment. The only proven method of stopping or slowing optic nerve damage is reducing IOP. Reduction of IOP by at least 30% appears to have the best chance of preventing further optic nerve damage. An optimal goal may be to reduce the IOP at least 30% below the threshold of progression. If damage is severe, greater reduction in IOP may be necessary.",
      "How to treat?\nThe main treatment options for glaucoma include medications, laser trabeculoplasty (LT) (selective [SLT] more commonly than argon [ALT]), and glaucoma surgery. Medications or LT are appropriate initial therapies. LT may be especially suitable in patients at risk for poor compliance, with medication side effects, and who have significant trabecular meshwork (TM) pigmentation. Surgery may be appropriate initial treatment if damage is advanced in the setting of a rapid rate of progression or difficult follow up. Options include glaucoma filtering surgery (e.g., trabeculectomy, tube shunt), minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), laser cyclophotocoagulation of the ciliary body (e.g., with diode laser or endolaser), and cyclocryotherapy. Surgery should always be considered for any patient with advanced/progressive disease or IOP uncontrolled by other methods."

[preservative free]) are to be used with caution in patients with active uveitis or cystoid macular edema (CME) and are contraindicated in pregnant women or in women wishing to become pregnant. Inform patients of potential pigment changes in iris and periorbital skin, as well as hypertrichosis of eyelashes. Irreversible iris pigment changes rarely occur in blue or dark brown eyes; those at highest risk for iris hyperpigmentation have hazel, gray irides.",

These medications theoretically could cause the same side effects as systemic CAIs, such as metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, paresthesias, and aplastic anemia. However, systemic symptoms from topical CAIs are extremely rare. There have been no reported cases of aplastic anemia from topical use. Corneal endothelial dysfunction may be exacerbated with topical CAIs; these medications should be used cautiously in patients with Fuchs corneal dystrophy and post keratoplasty.",

Miotics are usually contraindicated in patients with retinal holes and should be used cautiously in patients at risk for retinal detachment (e.g., high myopes and aphakes).\n\n NOTE: Pilocarpine is not routinely used at Wills Eye due to its adverse side effect profile including associated increased risk for uveitis and retinal detachment, possibility for miosis-induced angle closure, and symptoms such as headache.",
      "Sympathomimetics (dipivefrin 0.1% b.i.d. or epinephrine 0.5% to 2.0% b.i.d.) rarely reduce IOP to the degree of the other drugs but have few systemic side effects (rarely, cardiac arrhythmias). They often cause red eyes and may cause CME in aphakic patients.",
      "Systemic CAIs (e.g., methazolamide 25 to 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d., acetazolamide 125 to 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. to q.i.d., or acetazolamide 500 mg sequel p.o. b.i.d.) are relatively contraindicated in patients with renal failure. Potassium levels must be monitored if the patient is taking other diuretic agents or digitalis. Side effects such as fatigue, nausea, confusion, and paresthesias are common. Rare, but severe, hematologic side effects (e.g., aplastic anemia) and Stevens–Johnson syndrome have occurred. Allergy to sulfa drugs is not an absolute contraindication to the use of systemic CAIs, but extra caution should be exercised in monitoring for an allergic reaction. Intravenous forms of systemic CAIs (e.g., acetazolamide 250 to 500 mg i.v.) may be utilized if IOP decrease is urgent or if IOP is refractory to topical therapy. Consider checking baseline creatinine in patients with suspected or confirmed renal disease."

A decision to treat a patient should be based on the patient’s choice to elect therapy and baseline risk factors such as age, CCT, initial IOP, optic nerve appearance, and family history. The results of the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study showed that treatment reduced the development of visual field loss from 9.5% to 4.4% at 5 years, with a 20% average reduction of IOP. If treatment is elected, a therapeutic trial in one eye, as described for treatment of POAG, should be used. Some clinicians may elect to monitor these patients with close observation. Risk calculators have been developed to approximate the level of risk progression to glaucoma if left untreated. These may help guide clinicians and patients as to whether treatment should be initiated. See 9.1, Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma."

      "For pupillary block (all forms) or primary angle crowding: If the IOP decreases significantly, definitive treatment with yttrium–aluminum–garnet (YAG) laser PI or surgical iridectomy is performed once the cornea is clear and the anterior chamber is quiet, typically 1 to 5 days after attack.\n\n NOTE: If the affected eye is too inflamed initially for laser PI, perform laser PI of the fellow eye first. An untreated fellow eye has a 40% to 80% chance of acute angle closure in 5 to 10 years. Repeated angle closure attacks with a patent PI may indicate plateau iris syndrome. See 9.13, Plateau Iris.",
      "Patients are discharged on a regimen of maintenance dose IOP-lowering drops and oral medications (described above), as well as topical steroids if inflamed. Close monitoring with IOP measurement each day is necessary immediately after an angle closure attack. Once the IOP has been reasonably reduced, follow-up frequency is guided by overall clinical response and stability. On occasion, topical steroids in addition to IOP-lowering medications are necessary for 4 to 7 days to increase the chance of successful iridotomy.\n\n NOTE: If IOP does not decrease after two courses of maximal medical therapy, a laser (YAG) PI should be considered if there is an adequate view of the iris. If IOP still does not decrease after more than one attempt at laser PI, then a laser iridoplasty, surgical PI, or cataract surgery is needed, depending on the etiology. A guarded filtration procedure should also be considered based on the severity of glaucoma and anticipated IOP control after definitive treatment. If IOP remains elevated and the angle remains closed despite a patent iridectomy, surgical treatment of chronic angle closure is indicated.",
      "For secondary angle closure: Treat the underlying problem. Consider argon laser gonioplasty to open the angle, particularly in plateau iris syndrome or nanophthalmos. Goniosynechiolysis can be performed for chronic angle closure of <6 months’ duration. Systemic steroids may be required to treat serous choroidal detachments secondary to inflammation."

Tube-shunt procedures may be helpful to control IOP in some patients with active NV, but may be complicated by postoperative bleeding.

      "Intravitreal anti-VEGF agents (e.g., ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept) may be used to promote regression of iris NV prior to, or in conjunction with, filtering surgery or PRP. Their effect is temporary, and their use for treatment of NV is currently off-label. They are particularly useful in stage 1 and 2 neovascular glaucoma, where the angle is still open, to prevent angle closure during the interval required for PRP to take effect. Caution should be used when no view of the retina is possible. (See 11.12, Diabetic Retinopathy and 11.17, Neovascular or Exudative (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration, for a discussion on anti-VEGF agents.)",
      "In eyes without useful vision, topical steroids and cycloplegics may be adequate therapy for pain control. The pain in chronic neovascular glaucoma is not primarily a function of the IOP itself; thus, reducing IOP may not be necessary if the goal is pain control and comfort measures only. See 13.12, Blind, Painful Eye."

      "Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) (carotid–cavernous [“high-flow”] or dural–cavernous [“low-flow”]): Proptosis, chemosis, increased IOP, and dilated and tortuous (“corkscrew”) episcleral and conjunctival blood vessels are usually present (see Figure 10.10.1). Enhanced ocular pulsation (“pulsatile proptosis”) may occur, usually discernible on slit lamp examination during applanation. A bruit may be heard in high flow fistulas by the physician, and sometimes by the patient, with auscultation around the globe or temple. Reversed, arterialized flow in the superior ophthalmic vein is detectable with orbital color Doppler US. Orbital CT or MRI may show an enlarged superior ophthalmic vein. MRA or CTA may occasionally reveal the fistula, but definitive diagnosis usually requires arteriography. High-flow fistulas have an abrupt onset, often following trauma or rupture of an intracavernous aneurysm. Low-flow fistulas have a more insidious presentation, most commonly in hypertensive women >50 years of age, and are due to dural arteriovenous malformations. The Barrow classification is used for preoperative planning and subdivides carotid–cavernous fistulas as follows:\n\nDirect fistula.\nIndirect with branches solely from internal carotid artery (rare).\nIndirect with branches solely from external carotid artery.\nIndirect with branches from both internal and external carotid arteries (most common).",

      "Intracavernous aneurysm: Usually not ruptured. If aneurysm does rupture, the signs of a carotid–cavernous fistula develop.",
      "Zygomycosis (such as mucormycosis): Must be suspected in all diabetic patients, particularly those in ketoacidosis or recent poor sugar control and any debilitated or immunocompromised individual, especially patients on chemotherapy for cancer, with multiple cranial nerve palsies, with or without proptosis. Onset is typically acute. Bloody nasal discharge may be present, and nasal examination may reveal black, crusty material. This condition may produce massive hemispheric strokes and is always life threatening.",
      "Pituitary apoplexy: Acute onset of the critical signs listed previously; often bilateral with severe headache, decreased vision, and possibly bitemporal hemianopsia or blindness. A pre-existing pituitary adenoma may enlarge during pregnancy and predispose to apoplexy. Peripartum hemorrhage/shock can cause an infarction of the pituitary gland, leading to apoplexy of a nontumorous pituitary gland (Sheehan syndrome). An enlarged sella turcica or an intrasellar mass, usually with acute hemorrhage, is seen on CT scan or MRI of the brain. Note that this may be clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from lymphocytic hypophysitis.",
      "Varicella zoster virus: Patients with the typical zoster rash may develop ocular motor nerve palsies as well as a mid-dilated pupil that reacts better to convergence than to light.",
      "Cavernous sinus thrombosis: Proptosis, chemosis, and eyelid edema. Usually bilateral. Fever, nausea, vomiting, and an altered level of consciousness often develop. May result from spread of infection from the face, mouth, throat, sinus, or orbit. Less commonly noninfectious, resulting from trauma or surgery. These patients are deathly ill.",

May be associated with limitation of upward gaze, eyelid retraction, and bilateral mid-dilated pupils that react poorly to light but constrict better with convergence. Usually, a pineal region tumor or other dorsal midbrain abnormality is responsible. See 10.4, Adie (Tonic) Pupil.",

Consider a loading dose (prednisolone acetate 1% one drop every minute for 5 minutes at bedtime and awakening) or fluorometholone 0.1% ophthalmic ointment at night.

      "Cataracts are a frequent complication of intermediate uveitis. If cataract extraction is performed, the patient should ideally be free of inflammation for 3 months preceding the operation. Consider starting the patient on oral prednisone 60 mg daily 2 to 5 days prior to surgery and tapering the prednisone over the next 1 to 4 weeks. Aggressive perioperative use of topical NSAIDS (e.g., ketorolac 0.5% q.i.d.) and topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% q2h or difluprednate 0.05% six times a day) starting 2 to 5 days preoperatively and continued for at least 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively may reduce the risk of pseudophakic CME and recurrent uveitis. Consider a combined pars plana vitrectomy at the time of cataract surgery if significant vitreous opacification is present."

Usually spontaneously improves over weeks to months without treatment. May be associated with a cerebral vasculitis (consider MRA if the patient has a headache or other neurologic symptoms), in which case, systemic steroids are indicated.",

Uncommonly bilateral, sequential, or recurrent. Characterized by multiple, small white lesions deep in the retina or at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium with foveal granularity and occasionally vitreous cells. Fluorescein angiography may show a classic perifoveal “wreath-like” pattern. There is often an enlarged blind spot on formal visual field testing. Vision typically returns to normal within 6 to 8 weeks without treatment.",
      "Birdshot retinochoroidopathy: Usually middle-aged patients with multiple bilateral, oval, creamy-yellow spots deep to the retina, approximately 1 mm in diameter, scattered throughout the fundus but most prominent in inferior quadrants. A mild to moderate vitritis is present. Retinal vasculitis, CME, and optic nerve edema may be present. ICG angiography shows characteristic hypofluorescent spots but fluorescein angiography often shows only retinal vasculitis, CME, and “quenching” of dye. Positive HLA-A29 in 95% to 100% of patients. Early systemic immunosuppression is often recommended.",
      "Multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis: Visual loss in young myopic women more often than men, typically bilateral. Multiple, small, round, and pale inflammatory lesions (similar to histoplasmosis) are located at the level of the pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. Unlike histoplasmosis, vitritis occurs in 98% of patients. The lesions can occur in the macula and midperiphery and frequently respond to oral or periocular steroids, but typically recur with tapering, so that immunosuppressive therapy is often necessary. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) occurs in about 1/3 of patients, and so patients should return for urgent evaluation if they have decreased vision or metamorphopsia.",

Multiple, small round yellow-white spots predominantly in posterior pole with minimal intraocular inflammation. Lesions become well-demarcated atrophic scars within weeks. CNV may develop in up to 40% of patients. Systemic immunosuppression is usually indicated.",
      "Serpiginous choroidopathy: Typically bilateral, recurrent chorioretinitis characterized by acute lesions (yellow-white subretinal patches with indistinct margins) bordering old atrophic scars. The chorioretinal changes usually extend from the optic disc outward; however, one-third may begin in the macula. Patients are typically aged 30 to 60 years. CNV may develop. Systemic immunosuppression is usually indicated. Must be distinguished from the “serpiginous” pattern of tuberculous chorioretinitis.",
      "Toxocariasis: Typically unilateral. Usually occurs in children. The most common presentations are a macular granuloma (elevated white retinal/subretinal lesion) with poor vision, unilateral intermediate uveitis with peripheral granuloma, or endophthalmitis. A peripheral lesion may be associated with a fibrous band extending to the optic disc, sometimes resulting in macular vessel dragging. A severe vitritis and anterior uveitis may be present.

However, it requires the use of intravenous iodinated contrast. Also note that CTA requires significantly more radiation than CT. CTA should be avoided if at all possible in children; MRA is the preferred modality in the pediatric age group.",
      "CT scans may be obtained in children with careful consideration of the risk of radiation exposure versus benefits of performing the scan. According to the ALARA paradigm, it is best to avoid CT if possible in children unless there is no reasonable substitute. Check with your radiologist about using a pediatric protocol to limit radiation exposure. Each CT scan exposes children to a cumulative radiation dose that may increase the risk of malignancy over their lifetime. Radiation exposure from CT scans in children is of particular concern when serial imaging is required. In these cases, MRI/MRA is often a better choice for children, although intravenous sedation or general anesthesia may be needed because of the significantly longer scanning time."

PET is extremely useful in the diagnosis and surveillance of systemic pathologies, including metastases and aggressive subtypes of lymphoma. At present, the primary role of PET in the management of orbital disease is for diagnosis, surveillance, and response to therapy of any systemic component of the pathologic process.
