Mechanisms vary widely. Direct bony impingement on the optic canal may result from a skull base fracture that also involves adjacent structures, including the cavernous sinus, with resultant cranial neuropathy (see Figure 3.11.1).; Optic nerve sheath hematoma: An extremely rare and difficult to diagnose direct or indirect TON. Imaging may show perineural blood in the optic nerve sheath. Often a presumptive diagnosis requiring an abnormal fundus appearance, typically a combination of retinal venous and arterial occlusions (e.g., central retinal artery occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion).

Toxocariasis may also be acquired prenatally and present as a congenital infection.; Coats disease (see Figure 8.1.2): A retinal vascular abnormality resulting in microaneurysms and macroaneurysms of the retinal vessels, usually in the inferotemporal periphery. Xanthocoria may develop secondary to an exudative, often bullous retinal detachment associated with yellow-colored, lipid-rich subretinal fluid or to extensive, yellow intraretinal and subretinal exudate. Usually develops in boys during the first decade of life; more severe cases occur in early childhood. Coats disease is rarely bilateral.

See 12.13, Postoperative Endophthalmitis.; Retained lens material: A severe granulomatous inflammation with mutton-fat KP, resulting from an hypersensitivity reaction to lens protein exposed during surgery and may result in elevated IOP. See 9.12, Lens-Related Glaucoma.; Aseptic (sterile) endophthalmitis: A severe noninfectious postoperative uveitis caused by intraoperative injections (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide) or excess tissue manipulation, especially of vitreous manipulation, during surgery. A hypopyon and a mild vitreous cellular reaction may develop. Usually not characterized by profound or progressive pain or visual loss",
      "Acute papilledema: Bilateral disc edema, usually no decreased color vision, minimal to no decreased visual acuity, no pain with ocular motility, and no vitreous cells. See 10.15, Papilledema.; Severe systemic hypertension: Bilateral disc edema, increased blood pressure, flame-shaped retinal hemorrhages, and cotton–wool spots. See 11.10, Hypertensive Retinopathy.; Orbital tumor compressing the optic nerve: Unilateral and usually associated with proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, and/or restriction of extraocular motility. See 7.4, Orbital Tumors.; Intracranial mass compressing the afferent visual pathway: Normal or pale disc, afferent pupillary defect, decreased color vision, and mass evident on CT scan or MRI of the brain.; Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: Usually occurs in males in the second or third decade of life. Patients may have a family history and present with rapid visual loss of one and then the other eye within days to months. Early examination of the disc may reveal peripapillary telangiectasias followed by optic atrophy.; Toxic or metabolic optic neuropathy: Progressive painless bilateral visual loss",
      "Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE): Acute visual loss in young adults, often after a viral illness. Multiple, creamy yellow–white or gray, plaque-like subretinal lesions in both eyes (see Figure 12.3.1A and B). Lesions block early and stain late on IVFA. Usually spontaneously improves over weeks to months without treatment. May be associated with a cerebral vasculitis (consider MRA if the patient has a headache or other neurologic symptoms), in which case, systemic steroids are indicated.; Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS): Photopsias and acute unilateral visual loss, often after a viral illness and usually in young women. May have a shimmering scotoma. Uncommonly bilateral, sequential, or recurrent. Characterized by multiple, small white lesions deep in the retina or at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium with foveal granularity and occasionally vitreous cells. Fluorescein angiography may show a classic perifoveal “wreath-like” pattern. There is often an enlarged blind spot on formal visual field testing. Vision typically returns to normal within 6 to 8 weeks without treatment.; Birdshot retinochoroidopathy: Usually middle-aged patients with multiple bilateral, oval, creamy-yellow spots deep to the retina, approximately 1 mm in diameter, scattered throughout the fundus but most prominent in inferior quadrants. A mild to moderate vitritis is present. Retinal vasculitis, CME, and optic nerve edema may be present. ICG angiography shows characteristic hypofluorescent spots but fluorescein angiography often shows only retinal vasculitis, CME, and “quenching” of dye. Positive HLA-A29 in 95% to 100% of patients. Early systemic immunosuppression is often recommended.; Multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis: Visual loss",
      "acute HTN: May see retinal arteriolar narrowing and flame hemorrhages in chronic HTN. Acute HTN may have hard exudates, optic nerve swelling, exudative RD. See 11.10, Hypertensive Retinopathy.; Retinal vein occlusion: Unilateral, multiple hemorrhages, venous dilation, and tortuosity. Multiple CWSs, usually ≥6, seen in ischemic varieties. See 11.8, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion and 11.9, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion.; Retinal emboli: Often from carotid arteries or heart with resulting ischemia and subsequent CWS distal to arterial occlusion. Patients require carotid Doppler examination and echocardiography. See 10.22, Transient Visual Loss/Amaurosis Fugax.; Collagen vascular disease: Systemic lupus erythematosus (most common), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener granulomatosis), polyarteritis nodosa, scleroderma, etc.; Giant cell arteritis (GCA): Age ≥55 years. Symptoms include vision loss, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, proximal muscle aches, etc. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis).; HIV retinopathy: Single or multiple CWSs in the posterior pole. See 12.10, Noninfectious Retinal Microvasculopathy/HIV Retinopathy.; Other infections: Toxoplasmosis, orbital zygomycosis, Lyme disease, leptospirosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, onchocerciasis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, others.; Hypercoagulable state: Polycythemia, multiple myeloma, cryoglobulinemia, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden, activated protein C resistance, hyperhomocysteinemia, protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III mutation, prothrombin mutation, etc.; Radiation retinopathy: Follows radiation therapy to the eye or periocular structures when the eye is irradiated inadvertently. May occur any time after radiation, but occurs most commonly within a few years. Maintain a high suspicion even in patients in whom the eye was reportedly shielded. Usually, 3,000 cGy is necessary, but it has been noted to occur with 1,500 cGy. Resembles diabetic retinopathy.; Interferon therapy.; Purtscher and pseudo-Purtscher retinopathy: Multiple CWSs and/or superficial hemorrhages in a peripapillary configuration. Typically bilateral but can be unilateral and asymmetric. See 3.20, Purtscher Retinopathy.; Cancer: Metastatic carcinoma, leukemia, lymphoma, others.; Others: Migraine, hypotension, intravenous drug use, papilledema, papillitis, severe anemia, sickle cell, acute blood loss",
      "acute inflammatory phase, prednisone 1 mg/kg p.o. daily, tapered over 4 to 6 weeks, is a reasonable temporizing measure to improve proptosis and diplopia in preparation for orbital decompression surgery. There is evidence that the use of a 12-week course of pulsed intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. weekly for 6 weeks, followed by 250 mg i.v. weekly for 6 weeks) followed by a course of oral corticosteroids may result in better long-term control of TED with fewer systemic side effects than oral corticosteroids and is a reasonable option to offer patients in the acute phase of TED. Other experts question the long-term efficacy of this regimen. Periorbital corticosteroid injections are also used by some experts, but may be suboptimal to oral corticosteroids. Chronic systemic corticosteroids for long-term management should be avoided because of the systemic side effects. If systemic corticosteroids are used, a detailed discussion of the potential short- and long-term risks should be documented. The patient should undergo a baseline dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry bone density scan and be started on vitamin D/calcium supplements and gastric prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor. Close follow up with a primary care provider is also important for the management of blood sugar elevations and other side effects.; Orbital radiation: The use and efficacy of low-dose orbital radiation in the management of TED remain controversial. It may be used as a modality in the acute inflammatory phase of TED or as a means to limit progression and provide long-term control. Radiation therapy appears to decrease the severity and progression of restrictive strabismus in patients with active TED; efficacy in managing other aspects of TED (including optic neuropathy) has not been proved definitively, but is advocated by some experts. Radiation therapy should be used with caution in patients with diabetes, as it may worsen diabetic retinopathy, and in vasculopaths, as it may increase the risk of radiation retinopathy or optic neuropathy, although neither of these risks have been proven definitively. All patients offered radiation therapy should be informed of the potential risks. If used, radiation is best performed according to strict protocols with carefully controlled dosage and shielding under the supervision of a radiation oncologist familiar with the technique. Typically, a total dose of 20 Gy is administered in 10 to 14 fractions over 2 weeks. Treatment may transiently exacerbate inflammatory changes and an oral prednisone taper may mitigate these symptoms. Improvement is often seen within a few weeks of treatment, but may take several months to attain the maximal effect.; Selenium supplementation: Data from Europe confirm that the use of selenium supplementation (an antioxidant) reduces the severity and progression of mild-to-moderate TED. It remains unclear whether this finding is applicable in the United States, where no dietary selenium deficiency (as is present in certain European countries) exists. It is reasonable to offer this therapy to women with mild-to-moderate, active TED at a dose of 100 μg p.o. b.i.d for 6 months. Caution should be used in the use of selenium supplementation in men, especially with a family history of prostate cancer; some studies have suggested an increased risk of prostate cancer in males with high selenium levels, although this issue does not appear to have been settled conclusively.; Vitamin D supplementation: Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for TED. Vitamin D supplementation has been recommended with the hope of decreasing the risk of TED progression.; Biologics: Limited data are available on the use of biologic agents (e.g., rituximab, infliximab, adalimumab, etc.), with some studies showing efficacy and others finding none. Their use as primary therapy in lieu of more conventional modalities is, at present, off-label and controversial. Furthermore, there appears to be little consensus as to the most effective, specific biologic target in TED. Recently, the use of teprotumumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibitor of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) has shown promise in the management of TED. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in TED patients in January 2020. For patients with moderate to severe TED, the drug is effective in decreasing exophthalmos and diplopia.; Visual loss from optic neuropathy: Treat immediately with prednisone 1 mg/kg/d with close monitoring. In cases of severe visual loss",
      "acute loss of vision in most cases. See 11.8, Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.; Ischemic optic neuropathy: Disc swelling is pale but may be hyperemic; initially unilateral unless due to GCA, with sudden visual loss. See 10.17, Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Giant Cell Arteritis) and 10.18, Nonarteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.; Infiltration of the optic disc (e.g., sarcoid or tuberculous granuloma, leukemia, metastasis, other inflammatory disease or tumor): Other ocular or systemic abnormalities may be present. Usually unilateral.; Leber hereditary optic neuropathy: Usually occurs in males in the second or third decade of life. Patients may have a family history and present with rapid visual loss of one and then the other eye within days to months. Early examination of the disc may reveal peripapillary telangiectasias followed by optic atrophy.; Orbital optic nerve tumors: Unilateral disc swelling, may have proptosis.; Diabetic papillopathy: Benign disc edema in one or both eyes of a diabetic patient, most commonly with mild visual loss. No correlation with diabetic retinopathy. In addition to disc edema, disc hyperemia due to telangiectasias of the disc vessels may occur, simulating neovascularization. More common in patients with juvenile-onset diabetes. No treatment is indicated. Spontaneous resolution usually occurs after 3 to 4 months but may take even longer.; Thyroid-related optic neuropathy: May have eyelid lag or retraction, ocular misalignment, resistance to retropulsion. See 7.2.1, Thyroid Eye Disease.; Uveitis (e.g., syphilis or sarcoidosis): Pain or photophobia, anterior chamber/vitreous cells. See 12.3, Posterior Uveitis.; Amiodarone toxicity: May present with subacute visual loss",
