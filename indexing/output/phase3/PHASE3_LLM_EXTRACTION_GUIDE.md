# Phase 3: LLM-Enhanced Relationship Extraction Guide

## Overview

Phase 3 extracts relationships between medical entities (diseases, symptoms, signs, treatments, diagnostic tests) from The Wills Eye Manual. Two approaches are available:

1. **Rule-Based Co-occurrence** (`phase3_extract_relationships.py`) - Fast, cheap, less accurate
2. **LLM-Enhanced Extraction** (`phase3_llm_relationship_extraction.py`) - Slower, more expensive, highly accurate ⭐

## When to Use Each Approach

### Rule-Based Co-occurrence
**Best for:**
- Initial prototyping and testing
- Large-scale extraction where cost is a concern
- Extracting obvious relationships (disease-treatment in treatment sections)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fast (~2 minutes for full corpus)
- ✅ Zero cost (no LLM calls)
- ✅ Predictable output

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lower accuracy (many false positives from co-occurrence)
- ❌ Misses implicit relationships
- ❌ Cannot extract contraindications or complex relationships
- ❌ No evidence/context for relationships

### LLM-Enhanced Extraction ⭐
**Best for:**
- Production knowledge graph
- High-accuracy medical applications
- Extracting complex relationships (contraindications, complications)
- When you need evidence/citations for relationships

**Pros:**
- ✅ High accuracy (~90%+ precision with Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- ✅ Extracts implicit relationships
- ✅ Provides evidence quotes from source text
- ✅ Better handling of medical context
- ✅ Confidence scores for each relationship

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slower (~10-30 minutes for full corpus)
- ❌ Cost: ~$5-$15 for full extraction (depends on corpus size)
- ❌ Requires API key

## Relationship Types Extracted

### 1. **presents_with** (Disease → Symptom)
Patient-reported symptoms associated with a disease.

**Example:**
- "Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma" → "severe eye pain"
- "Keratitis" → "photophobia"

### 2. **associated_with** (Disease → Sign)
Clinical findings observed during examination.

**Example:**
- "Bacterial Keratitis" → "corneal infiltrate"
- "Uveitis" → "anterior chamber cells"

### 3. **treated_with** (Disease → Treatment)
Treatments, medications, or procedures used for a disease.

**Example:**
- "Bacterial Keratitis" → "fortified antibiotics"
- "Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma" → "laser peripheral iridotomy"

### 4. **diagnosed_with** (Disease → Diagnostic Test)
Tests or imaging used to diagnose a disease.

**Example:**
- "Glaucoma" → "tonometry"
- "Retinal Detachment" → "OCT"

### 5. **contraindicated_with** (Treatment → Disease/Condition)
Safety relationships indicating when a treatment should NOT be used.

**Example:**
- "Steroids" → "HSV keratitis" (contraindicated)
- "Atropine" → "narrow angles" (contraindicated)

### 6. **can_cause** (Disease → Complication)
Potential complications or downstream effects.

**Example:**
- "Untreated Glaucoma" → "vision loss"
- "Corneal Ulcer" → "perforation"

## Prompt Engineering

### Current Prompt Strategy

The LLM extraction uses a structured prompt with:
1. **Role definition**: "Medical knowledge graph expert"
2. **Entity type definitions**: Clear ontology
3. **Relationship type taxonomy**: 6 types with examples
4. **Output format**: JSON schema with required fields
5. **Context**: Known entities in the text block
6. **Guidelines**: Confidence scoring, evidence extraction

### Customizing the Prompt

To modify extraction behavior, edit `RELATIONSHIP_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` in `phase3_llm_relationship_extraction.py`:

```python
RELATIONSHIP_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
[Your custom prompt here]

Key variables:
- {text}: The medical text to analyze
- {diseases}: Comma-separated disease names in text
- {symptoms}: Comma-separated symptom names
- {signs}: Comma-separated sign names
- {treatments}: Comma-separated treatment names
- {tests}: Comma-separated test names
"""
```

**Tips for prompt engineering:**
- Keep instructions clear and concise
- Use medical domain terminology
- Provide 2-3 examples per relationship type
- Specify confidence scoring criteria explicitly
- Request exact evidence quotes from source text

## Cost Estimation

### Pricing (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- **Input**: $0.003 per 1K tokens
- **Output**: $0.015 per 1K tokens

### Estimated Costs by Corpus Size

| Text Blocks | Estimated Cost | Processing Time |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 50 blocks | $0.50 - $1.00 | 2-5 minutes |
| 100 blocks | $1.00 - $2.00 | 5-10 minutes |
| 500 blocks | $5.00 - $10.00 | 15-30 minutes |
| 1000+ blocks | $10.00 - $20.00 | 30-60 minutes |

**Cost-saving tips:**
1. Use `--max-blocks` for testing before full run
2. Filter text blocks by section type (focus on treatment/diagnostic sections)
3. Use rule-based for obvious relationships, LLM for complex ones
4. Process only high-priority chapters first (e.g., Chapter 3: Trauma)

---

## Quality Validation

### Confidence Thresholds

After extraction, filter by confidence:

```python
# High confidence only (production use)
high_conf = [r for r in relationships if r["weight"] >= 0.9]

# Medium+ confidence (testing)
med_conf = [r for r in relationships if r["weight"] >= 0.7]
```

### Manual Validation

Sample 100 random relationships for manual review:

```python
import random
sample = random.sample(relationships, 100)

# Check:
# 1. Does source entity actually relate to target?
# 2. Is relationship type correct?
# 3. Does evidence support the relationship?
```

### Common Error Patterns

1. **False Positives**: Entities mentioned in same text but unrelated
   - *Mitigation*: Require explicit relationship verbs in evidence
2. **Wrong Relationship Type**: Confusing "presents_with" vs "associated_with"
   - *Mitigation*: Clearer prompt examples
3. **Entity Name Mismatch**: LLM uses synonym not in entity list
   - *Mitigation*: Add synonym normalization step

## Integration with GraphRAG Pipeline

### Workflow

```
Phase 1: Content Extraction
  ↓
Phase 2: Entity Extraction
  ↓
Phase 3 (LLM): Relationship Extraction  ← YOU ARE HERE
  ↓
Phase 4: Community Detection (Leiden algorithm)
  ↓
Phase 5: Red Flag Extraction
  ↓
Phase 6: Neo4j Import
```

### Next Steps After Extraction

1. **Merge with rule-based relationships** (optional)
   ```python
   # Combine both approaches, LLM relationships override co-occurrence
   merged = llm_relationships + [r for r in cooccurrence_relationships
                                  if (r["source"], r["target"]) not in llm_pairs]
   ```

2. **Validate red flag relationships**
   - Ensure all emergent conditions have correct symptom relationships
   - Required for Phase 5 red flag detection

3. **Prepare for community detection**
   - Check relationship distribution (no isolated nodes)
   - Verify relationship weights are normalized (0.0-1.0)

4. **Import to Neo4j**
   - Convert to Cypher statements
   - Create indexes for fast traversal

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found"
**Solution**: Set environment variable before running script

### Issue: JSON decode error
**Possible causes:**
- LLM returned markdown code block (handled automatically)
- LLM returned malformed JSON
- LLM returned explanatory text instead of JSON

**Solution**: Check prompt is clear about "return ONLY JSON"

### Issue: Very few relationships extracted
**Possible causes:**
- Text blocks don't contain enough entities
- Entity names don't match textbook terminology

**Solution**:
- Review Phase 2 entity extraction quality
- Add entity synonyms to Phase 2 output

### Issue: High cost
**Solution**:
- Use `--max-blocks` to process subset
- Focus on high-value chapters (3, 4, 9, 11)
- Use rule-based for obvious relationships first

---

## Performance Optimization

### Current Bottlenecks
1. **Sequential LLM calls**: Each text block processed individually
2. **Long prompts**: Including all entity names increases token cost

### Future Improvements
1. **Batch processing**: Process multiple blocks in single LLM call
2. **Smart filtering**: Only extract from high-value sections
3. **Two-pass extraction**: Use cheap model for filtering, Claude for final extraction
4. **Caching**: Store results to avoid re-processing unchanged blocks

---

## Medical Safety Considerations

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: This is medical software. All relationships must be validated.

### Safety Checks Before Production Use

1. **Red flag validation**
   - Verify all emergent conditions have correct symptom relationships
   - Test: "chemical burn" → "eye exposure" relationship exists

2. **Contraindication accuracy**
   - Manually review ALL contraindicated_with relationships
   - False positives can cause patient harm

3. **Treatment recommendations**
   - Verify treated_with relationships cite Wills Eye Manual evidence
   - Include source chapter/section for all treatments

4. **Urgency propagation**
   - Ensure symptoms of emergent diseases are flagged correctly
   - Test: "sudden vision loss" triggers red flag

### Audit Trail

All LLM-extracted relationships include:
- Source text evidence
- Chapter/section reference
- Model version used
- Extraction timestamp (add if needed)

## Examples

### Example 1: Extracting from Keratitis Section

**Input text:**
> "Bacterial keratitis presents with severe eye pain, photophobia, and decreased vision. Slit-lamp examination reveals a corneal infiltrate with overlying epithelial defect. Treatment includes fortified topical antibiotics (cefazolin and tobramycin). Fluorescein staining aids in diagnosis."

**Extracted relationships:**
```json
[
  {
    "source": "disease_keratitis",
    "target": "symptom_eye_pain",
    "relationship_type": "presents_with",
    "weight": 1.0,
    "evidence": "Bacterial keratitis presents with severe eye pain"
  },
  {
    "source": "disease_keratitis",
    "target": "sign_corneal_infiltrate",
    "relationship_type": "associated_with",
    "weight": 1.0,
    "evidence": "Slit-lamp examination reveals a corneal infiltrate"
  },
  {
    "source": "disease_keratitis",
    "target": "treatment_antibiotics",
    "relationship_type": "treated_with",
    "weight": 1.0,
    "evidence": "Treatment includes fortified topical antibiotics"
  },
  {
    "source": "disease_keratitis",
    "target": "test_fluorescein_staining",
    "relationship_type": "diagnosed_with",
    "weight": 0.9,
    "evidence": "Fluorescein staining aids in diagnosis"
  }
]
```

### Example 2: Contraindication Extraction

**Input text:**
> "Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in suspected HSV keratitis as they can exacerbate viral replication and lead to corneal perforation."

**Extracted relationships:**
```json
[
  {
    "source": "treatment_corticosteroids",
    "target": "disease_hsv_keratitis",
    "relationship_type": "contraindicated_with",
    "weight": 1.0,
    "evidence": "Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in suspected HSV keratitis"
  },
  {
    "source": "treatment_corticosteroids",
    "target": "complication_corneal_perforation",
    "relationship_type": "can_cause",
    "weight": 0.9,
    "evidence": "they can...lead to corneal perforation"
  }
]
```
