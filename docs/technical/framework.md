Chainlit is specifically designed for conversational AI applications and provides the best experience for chatbots and LangChain/LangGraph applications with real-time chat interfaces. It's ideal for your multi-phase medical triage workflow because:

**Key Features for Your Use Case:**
- Native support for chat lifecycle hooks that let you control what happens at different stages of a chat, UI actions with buttons and callbacks, message streaming, and chat persistence configuration
- Built-in observability features that provide step-by-step visualization of the conversation flow, showing the exact prompt sent to the LLM, which tools were used, and the final output
- Deep integration with LangGraph
- Built-in monitoring and analytics through Literal AI for tracking API calls

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install chainlit langgraph langchain-openai
```

## **Recommended Architecture for Your Triage System**

```
User Interface: Chainlit
↓
Conversation Flow: LangGraph (state machine for phases 1-5)
↓
Knowledge Base: GraphRAG in Neo4j
↓
External Integration: Paziresh24.ir API for appointments
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Start with Chainlit + LangGraph** for rapid development
2. Use LangGraph's `StateGraph` to implement your 5-phase triage workflow
3. Leverage LangGraph's built-in persistence layer with checkpointer for managing conversation state across multiple turns
4. Connect to Neo4j for GraphRAG queries
5. Add custom actions for red flag detection and appointment booking

## **Quick Start Code Pattern**

Here's the pattern used across successful implementations:

```python
import chainlit as cl
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Define your triage state machine with phases
workflow = StateGraph(state_schema=YourTriageState)
workflow.add_node("consent", consent_phase)
workflow.add_node("intake", intake_phase)
workflow.add_node("triage", triage_phase)
# ... add other phases

@cl.on_chat_start
async def start():
    # Initialize session
    cl.user_session.set("phase", "consent")

@cl.on_message
async def main(message: cl.Message):
    # Process through LangGraph workflow
    response = await workflow.invoke({"messages": message.content})
    await cl.Message(content=response).send()
```

**My Recommendation:** Start with **Chainlit + LangGraph** as it aligns perfectly with your stack and provides the flexibility needed for your complex multi-phase triage workflow while maintaining the observability critical for medical applications.
